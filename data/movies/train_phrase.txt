<phrase_Q=1.000>OK</phrase>, this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> was cool. I don't think it was the best <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> ever made but it sure was fun. My brother and I still <phrase_Q=1.000>act</phrase> out scenes once in a while, and will occasionally yank the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and <phrase_Q=1.000>pop</phrase> it in. Enjoyable all the way until the end, but a great concept. This is a <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy. Judgment is victory for <phrase_Q=1.000>Robot</phrase> Jox.
I so wanted to believe in this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> after the only form of mainstream <phrase_Q=1.000>comedy</phrase> this <phrase_Q=1.000>country</phrase> recognises is <phrase_Q=1.000>slapstick</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>stereotypes</phrase>. Of course, it went completely the other way - let's be cool and edgy - and came out the other side with little to show for it. I <phrase_Q=1.000>bet</phrase> One Small <phrase_Q=1.000>Seed</phrase> went nuts for this. I know <phrase_Q=1.000>SL</phrase> did. None of the <phrase_Q=0.722>main characters</phrase> have the comedic chops to pull it off. Even Danny K had better timing. I'm actually being serious. Every time they introduced a <phrase_Q=1.000>bit</phrase> character I kept thinking, "Darn, this person should have been the <phrase_Q=1.000>lead</phrase>!". <phrase_Q=1.000>Independent</phrase> doesn't mean that the <phrase_Q=1.000>camera</phrase> work needs to be horrible. <phrase_Q=1.000>Black</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>white</phrase> did nothing for this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> - actually with such flat dialogue it hurt this even more by bringing the boredom into sharp <phrase_Q=1.000>relief</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=1.000>black</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>white</phrase> also wasn't crisp. The composition was horrible. The use of <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase> was horrible. Strangely enough I watched Little Miss Sunshine after this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> and the composition on that was superb - maybe that's why the deficiencies in this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> stick out in my mind. I think Corne ( who was funnier than the leads before he even said anything ) was speaking to this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> and not <phrase_Q=1.000>David</phrase> - see it and you'll understand. I <phrase_Q=1.000>bet</phrase> the guys who organise <phrase_Q=1.000>Oppikoppi</phrase> were dismayed. One would think nothing happens there at all. I got the feeling it could have been filmed in someone's back <phrase_Q=1.000>garden</phrase>. I know regular guys who have much funnier, raunchier and wittier conversations than any of these "<phrase_Q=1.000>comics</phrase>". The dude who they hooked up with end was <phrase_Q=1.000>OK</phrase> though. Guess SA comedy's gonna stay in the <phrase_Q=1.000>stone age</phrase> a little longer. <phrase_Q=1.000>Nice</phrase> work guys.
Seriously, I'm all for gooey <phrase_Q=1.000>romantic</phrase> comedies and will get sucked into Miss Congeniality as easily as <phrase_Q=1.000>Goodfellas</phrase>...but this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>? It doesn't make any sense!!!! And I'm not even talking about the willing suspension of disbelief kind of not making sense. Why does her <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>live</phrase> in <phrase_Q=1.000>England</phrase>? Or, at the very least, why doesn't she have a <phrase_Q=1.000>British</phrase> accent? She's sure cozy with her dad and he's surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two years. ( On that subject, no one ever makes much of a deal about her being away for so <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase> ) . And what was with the <phrase_Q=1.000>goofy</phrase> outfits at the <phrase_Q=1.000>bachelorette party</phrase>? I'm not even going to get into the fact that the <phrase_Q=1.000>escort</phrase> she paid for <phrase_Q=1.000>falls</phrase> in <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> with her--that could've been overcome by better <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>-making. I'm just saying that the characters, the setting, and the plot aren't fleshed out enough to make an even somewhat cohesive story. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the filmmaker's consistent use of the most unflattering angles on Deborah Messing's nose--I'd have sued the filmmakers if I were her! I mean, honestly, I'm all for women being who they are, but why, in seven loyal years of Will and Grace viewing, have I not ever noticed how incredibly odd her nose is? Oh! Because those producers are kind to her! This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, like my other least favorite <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> ever, <phrase_Q=1.000>Armageddon</phrase>, is the fault of the filmmakers, not the <phrase_Q=1.000>actors</phrase>. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better <phrase_Q=1.000>writer</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>director</phrase>, and <phrase_Q=1.000>producer</phrase>. This easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies I've ever wasted time on. I'm just glad a friend loaned me her <phrase_Q=1.000>DVD</phrase>, so all I wasted was time. If there were a way to make this review ZERO <phrase_Q=1.000>stars</phrase>, I'd do it.
`Stanley and Iris' is a <phrase_Q=1.000>heart</phrase> warming <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase>. Stanley's <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> is difficult, because he never learned to read or write. Iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a <phrase_Q=1.000>bakery</phrase> where she meets Stanley. She decides to teach Stanley how to read at her home in her spare time. Over time they become romantically involved. After Stanley learns to read, he goes off to a good job in <phrase_Q=1.000>Chicago</phrase>, only to return to Iris and ask her to marry him. It's a really good <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> without <phrase_Q=1.000>nudity</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>violence</phrase>, or <phrase_Q=1.000>profanity</phrase>, that which is rare in today's <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase>. A good <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> all round.
Sometimes a <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> comes along that is unique. The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker is one such <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker is like no other <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> I have ever seen, unfortunately for The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker & myself it's unique for different reasons than what the filmmakers had <phrase_Q=0.908>originally intended</phrase>. Read on & all shall hopefully become clear... The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker, as it's commonly know although it was apparently filmed under the title The Changer, starts with some extremely dull shots of an <phrase_Q=1.000>American</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>town</phrase> somewhere, streets & factory's that sort of thing, as the <phrase_Q=0.888>opening credits</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>play</phrase>. When The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker begins proper we, the viewer that is, are introduced to a real loser named Joe <phrase_Q=1.000>Bukowski</phrase> ( Carl Zschering ) who is in his 40's, he lives on his own in a crappy little <phrase_Q=1.000>apartment</phrase> where he watches T.V., eats <phrase_Q=1.000>beef</phrase> flavoured <phrase_Q=1.000>dog food</phrase> & listens to old <phrase_Q=1.000>vinyl</phrase> records as he dances with a blow up <phrase_Q=1.000>rubber</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>sex doll</phrase>. Joe likes <phrase_Q=0.919>teenage girls</phrase>, he has various porn <phrase_Q=1.000>magazines</phrase> but enjoys the real thing even more. However, being an ugly git Joe can't tempt any <phrase_Q=0.750>young ladies</phrase> to go out with him, or do anything else with him for that <phrase_Q=1.000>matter</phrase>. One fateful day an old <phrase_Q=1.000>homeless</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Vietnam</phrase> vet ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Horace</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Grimm</phrase> ) sees the agony & <phrase_Q=1.000>pain</phrase> that Joe has to go through ( actually he sees Joe being spoken to by the cops for hassling a <phrase_Q=0.844>teenage girl</phrase> ) & decides to help him out. He tells Joe about an <phrase_Q=1.000>incantation</phrase> that he learned from the 'gooks' in <phrase_Q=1.000>Vietnam</phrase> that will transform Joe's appearance into whatever he likes. A process he calls morphosynthesis, but at the same time he warns Joe that 'it makes you crazy if you do it too much'. That night Joe decides to give it a try, in a <phrase_Q=1.000>public</phrase> place on a podium for some reason. Joe says a few words, does an extremely silly <phrase_Q=1.000>dance</phrase> & starts yodelling. Joe finishes off by whistling <phrase_Q=1.000>London Bridge</phrase> is Falling Down, listen yeah, I ain't making this up either. At first Joe is visibly disappointed when nothing significant happens. To <phrase_Q=1.000>console</phrase> himself Joe tries to buy a porn mag but is shocked when the clerk ( Kevin Devoy ) refuses to sell it to an underage girl. Joe, the bright spark that he is, realises what has happened & talks his/her way out of it by claiming his/her dad had sent him/her to buy it. Joe, who now calls his <phrase_Q=1.000>alter-ego</phrase> Josephine ( Ann <phrase_Q=1.000>Flood</phrase> ) , senses the possibilities & heads straight for the local <phrase_Q=1.000>high school</phrase>. Joe befriends four <phrase_Q=0.919>teenage girls</phrase>, Jennifer Armstrong ( Laura Cummings ) , Crisi Stroud ( Gail Didia ) , Tracy Harper ( Heidi M. Gregg ) & Brenda Kearn ( Aimee Molinaro ) while under his disguise, oh & Joe manages to become a pupil at the <phrase_Q=1.000>school</phrase> simply by asking the <phrase_Q=1.000>sports</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>teacher</phrase> Miss <phrase_Q=0.968>Van Dyke</phrase> ( Vicki Hollis ) . At first Joe seems harmless enough, he just likes to hang around the girls toilets & stuff like that. But things soon change as Joe brutally murders Brenda. Jennifer's dad, Vince Armstrong ( Edward Tanner ) is a <phrase_Q=1.000>detective</phrase> so along with his partner Ed Simpson ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Clyde</phrase> Surrell ) & <phrase_Q=1.000>Walt</phrase> Spencer ( Bruce Alden ) the <phrase_Q=1.000>pathologist</phrase> is determined to catch the <phrase_Q=1.000>sicko</phrase> responsible for killing his daughter's <phrase_Q=1.000>friends</phrase>, but will they succeed before Joe strikes again? The <phrase_Q=1.000>IMDb</phrase> listing for The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker is wrong, I watched it mere hours ago & it clearly states that it's <phrase_Q=1.000>directed</phrase> by Mark Nowicki who was also a co-<phrase_Q=1.000>producer</phrase> & definitely not Patrick J. Matthews who was credited as a co-<phrase_Q=1.000>producer</phrase> & the <phrase_Q=1.000>cinematographer</phrase>, not that it makes much difference & I'd have though that Nowicki would have been more than happy for Matthews to take the 'credit' for making this piece of crap. No one involved in the making of The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker should be allowed to go anywhere near a <phrase_Q=1.000>camera</phrase> again, ever. The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker is easily one of the worst <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> I've ever seen, & that's saying something. It's <phrase_Q=0.798>absolutely terrible</phrase> in every possible way imaginable. The script by Steven Hodge is atrocious, there's no <phrase_Q=1.000>narrative structure</phrase>, excitement, tension, <phrase_Q=1.000>drama</phrase>, <phrase_Q=0.826>character development</phrase> & the things that do happen are so <phrase_Q=0.927>mind numbingly</phrase> dumb it's untrue. The <phrase_Q=0.797>plot devices</phrase> & chain of events in The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker are totally incomprehensible. The scene where Joe finds out the <phrase_Q=1.000>prostitute</phrase> ( Steven Andrews ) he hired is in fact a man & Joe starts to chase him around his <phrase_Q=1.000>apartment</phrase> with two squirting dildo's is simply <phrase_Q=0.949>jaw dropping</phrase> stuff. The subsequent scene when the <phrase_Q=1.000>transvestite</phrase> reports the incident to the <phrase_Q=1.000>police</phrase> is hilariously written & had me psychically laughing at the dialogue. I hated the ending as well, not only was it predictable but it <phrase_Q=1.000>leaves</phrase> the door open for a <phrase_Q=1.000>sequel</phrase>, I psychically shudder at the mere thought! On a technical level The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker is awful, point & hope <phrase_Q=1.000>photography</phrase>, bland & inappropriate <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase>, forgettable locations, <phrase_Q=0.899>poorly edited</phrase> ( Brenda is killed in the kitchen yet her <phrase_Q=1.000>blood</phrase> splashes on the T.V. screen that was clearly in the opposite room ) , some of the worst acting I've <phrase_Q=1.000>sat</phrase> through & very unimpressive <phrase_Q=1.000>special effects</phrase> which consist of a few cut off <phrase_Q=1.000>rubber</phrase> fingers, a slit throat & a quick scene where Joe eats some flesh. It comes as no surprise that the cast & crew who worked on The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker have virtually no <phrase_Q=1.000>IMDb</phrase> credits for anything before or after. Even at 76 <phrase_Q=0.767>odd minutes</phrase> The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker is far to <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase> & really boring to sit through. I could go on & on all day <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase> about how bad The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker is, I really could. One thing I can't quite work out is was all this intentional by the filmmakers? The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker is indeed a unique <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, unique in it's awfulness & incompetence. In the the case of The <phrase_Q=1.000>Nostril</phrase> Picker I hope it remains unique too, having said that it's still not the worst <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> I've ever seen but it comes close that's for sure. Definitely one to avoid.
Every great <phrase_Q=1.000>gangster</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> has under-currents of <phrase_Q=1.000>human drama</phrase>. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from "Scarface". This is a <phrase_Q=1.000>tale</phrase> of ferocious greed, <phrase_Q=1.000>corruption</phrase>, and power. The darker side of the fabled "<phrase_Q=1.000>American Dream</phrase>". Anybody complaining about the "cheesiness" of this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase>, and dated fashions further <phrase_Q=1.000>fuel</phrase> the criticism of this <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really <phrase_Q=1.000>matter</phrase>, not on any <phrase_Q=1.000>human</phrase> level at least. In fact the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> practically borderlines <phrase_Q=1.000>satire</phrase>, ironic considering all the <phrase_Q=1.000>gangsta</phrase> rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of <phrase_Q=1.000>Tony Montana</phrase>. This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest <phrase_Q=0.852>directorial effort</phrase>, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled ( particularly the memorable finale ) , but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by <phrase_Q=1.000>Oliver Stone</phrase> ( probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time ) . The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>Tony Montana</phrase>, and the <phrase_Q=1.000>evolution</phrase> of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and <phrase_Q=1.000>drama</phrase>. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into <phrase_Q=1.000>popular culture</phrase> in one form or another. The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. One of his earlier less subtle performances ( something much more common from him nowadays ) , this is a world entirely separate from <phrase_Q=1.000>Michael Corleone</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>Frank Serpico</phrase>. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining ( and intentionally over-the-top ) form. It is hard to imagine another <phrase_Q=1.000>Tony Montana</phrase> after seeing this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. <phrase_Q=1.000>Pfeiffer</phrase> stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The <phrase_Q=0.915>supporting players</phrase> are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro <phrase_Q=1.000>Sosa</phrase>. Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. "Scarface" is one of the <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> of the eighties ( whatever that might mean to you ) . An essential and accessible <phrase_Q=1.000>gangster</phrase> flick, and a <phrase_Q=1.000>pop-culture</phrase> landmark. 9/10
It takes a <phrase_Q=1.000>Serbian</phrase> or at least a <phrase_Q=1.000>Balkan</phrase> familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as of many other <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> of Kusturica. See for example the <phrase_Q=0.741>opening scenes</phrase>, with the remote <phrase_Q=1.000>village</phrase> in the <phrase_Q=1.000>Serbian</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>mountains</phrase>, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> of the inhabitants, the <phrase_Q=1.000>nostalgia</phrase> for the good days of the <phrase_Q=1.000>Communist</phrase> rule, and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude <phrase_Q=1.000>teacher</phrase> at the sounds of the <phrase_Q=1.000>Soviet</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>hymn</phrase>. Kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic <phrase_Q=1.000>history</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>Serbia</phrase> described in his previous movies, but creates a whole world of himself in the process. This is not a <phrase_Q=1.000>political</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> or not an explicit <phrase_Q=1.000>political</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> in any case. It's a fun <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> before all. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. <phrase_Q=1.000>Music</phrase> plays an active role in this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> same as in all his other movies. His style is direct and <phrase_Q=1.000>grotesque</phrase>, we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same. The space he develops melds present, <phrase_Q=1.000>history</phrase> and magic, and the colours seem to be of a Douanier <phrase_Q=1.000>Rousseau</phrase> of modern cinema. This is not a perfect <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> either. The principal flaw is the length, some <phrase_Q=1.000>editing</phrase> and shortening would have been useful, as at some point in time the <phrase_Q=1.000>director</phrase> seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up. It is yet one of the most catching, amusing, moving <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> that I have seen lately.
I have been a fan of this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> for years and years. Because of Teri Hatchers move into the forefront, I had to take the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> off the shelf and <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it. Why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> was in beyond me? <phrase_Q=1.000>Sally Field</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>Kevin Kline</phrase> are beyond fabulous. Although I never have watching <phrase_Q=0.889>daytime soap</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>operas</phrase>, this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> kills me every time I <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it. The acting is second to none for a <phrase_Q=1.000>comedy</phrase> and the writing is so smart. I <phrase_Q=0.804>highly recommend</phrase> that you <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> this if you haven't already. You will get to see Elizabeth Shue, <phrase_Q=1.000>Whoopi Goldberg</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Teri Hatcher</phrase>, and <phrase_Q=1.000>Carrie Fisher</phrase>...to name a few...all give splendid performances.
This is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. I <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> the backwoods feel of this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is very realistic and believable. This seems to take place in another <phrase_Q=1.000>era</phrase>, maybe the late 60's or early 70's. <phrase_Q=1.000>Henry Thomas</phrase> works well with the young baby. Very moving story and worth a look.
I chuckled a few times during this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. I laughed out loud during the notarizing of the <phrase_Q=1.000>margarine</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>company</phrase> handover ( <phrase_Q=1.000>pun</phrase> intended ) . There are three segments in this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. The first one is supposed to be a spoof of "woman 'grows up' and launches career" movies. The <phrase_Q=1.000>Tampax</phrase>® box was the <phrase_Q=0.797>funniest thing</phrase> in this segment. Most of the <phrase_Q=0.885>cast members</phrase> aren't <phrase_Q=1.000>listed</phrase> here on <phrase_Q=1.000>IMDb</phrase>. They are the lucky ones. Few other people will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers. The second segment is a spoof of "sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge <phrase_Q=1.000>industry</phrase>" movies. <phrase_Q=1.000>Robert Culp</phrase> has several <phrase_Q=0.754>funny moments</phrase>, all physical humor, including the aforementioned handover. After his character dies the segment sinks <phrase_Q=1.000>lower</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>lower</phrase> as Dominique Corsaire rises higher and higher. By the time she becomes First Lady I wanted to rip the <phrase_Q=1.000>cable</phrase> out of the <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> "<phrase_Q=1.000>snow</phrase>." I switched to Pakistani <phrase_Q=1.000>music videos</phrase> instead. I don't understand <phrase_Q=1.000>Urdu</phrase>, or whatever <phrase_Q=1.000>language</phrase> the videos were in. It was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull "story." Then came "Municipalians" with the *big* <phrase_Q=1.000>stars</phrase>, half of them on screen for less than a minute: <phrase_Q=0.989>Elisha Cook</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Jr</phrase>., <phrase_Q=1.000>Christopher Lloyd</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Rhea Perlman</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Henny Youngman</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Julie Kavner</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Richard Widmark</phrase> and ... *<phrase_Q=1.000>Robby Benson</phrase>.* It's supposed to be a spoof of "young cop teams with hardened, substance abusing older cop who needs retirement *badly*" movies. The horizontal <phrase_Q=1.000>flash</phrase> bar on the <phrase_Q=1.000>police car</phrase> is very impressive. It was interesting seeing old RTD <phrase_Q=1.000>buses</phrase>, and a Shell <phrase_Q=1.000>gas</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>station</phrase> sign, and an <phrase_Q=1.000>American</phrase> Savings sign -- none of them are around anymore. Nagurski's "Never stop anywhere you might have to get out the <phrase_Q=1.000>car</phrase>" made me smile momentarily. Then they discuss how boring the young cop is. A lot. Back and forth about how boring he is. That was as boring as this description of how boring it is. Nagurski's <phrase_Q=1.000>Law</phrase> Number Four, "Never go into a <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase> store that's been cut into with an <phrase_Q=1.000>acetylene</phrase> torch," made me think that the <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase> store is a real <phrase_Q=1.000>business</phrase> at the actual location the <phrase_Q=1.000>dispatcher</phrase> gave. Thinking about that was more interesting than the set-up for the gag which followed. Young <phrase_Q=1.000>Falcone</phrase> ( Benson ) gets <phrase_Q=1.000>shot</phrase>. A lot. He becomes a hardened cop like Nagurski. The segment keeps going. On and on. And on. It won't stop. It rolls relentlessly onward no <phrase_Q=1.000>matter</phrase> how many times you wish he'd just *die* already so this thing will end. It doesn't. It goes on and on and on.... Then a "<phrase_Q=1.000>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</phrase>" episode which I've seen four times already comes on. Thank <phrase_Q=1.000>God</phrase>! This abysmal <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> ended while I went to get the <phrase_Q=1.000>mail</phrase>.
<phrase_Q=1.000>Lost</phrase> is largely considered one of the most beautiful <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> series that have never done ... and so is ... if you lovers of mysteries, intrigue and <phrase_Q=1.000>adventure</phrase> this is the series for you ...In the first <phrase_Q=1.000>season</phrase> ... since the first episode starts to go increasingly to move <phrase_Q=1.000>forward</phrase> until you get to the second <phrase_Q=1.000>season</phrase> ... in the second you lose a little its <phrase_Q=1.000>cocktail</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>mystery</phrase> and expectation and pushes very on and reveal the various mysteries that the <phrase_Q=1.000>island</phrase> hides ... the third <phrase_Q=1.000>season</phrase> is perhaps the second most beautiful because resumed suffered since the first episode with the pace and tenacity of the first <phrase_Q=1.000>season</phrase> ... the fourth also not let <phrase_Q=1.000>pass</phrase> unnoticed and tends to reveal a little mysteries ... but not as the second <phrase_Q=1.000>season</phrase> but at a somewhat different ...

Probably my all-time favorite <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not preachy or boring. It just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. <phrase_Q=1.000>Paul Lukas</phrase>' performance brings tears to my eyes, and <phrase_Q=1.000>Bette Davis</phrase>, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. The kids are, as grandma says, more like "dressed-up midgets" than children, but that only makes them more fun to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase>. And the mother's slow awakening to what's happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. If I had a dozen thumbs, they'd all be "up" for this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>.
I just came back from "El Otro" playing here in <phrase_Q=1.000>Buenos Aires</phrase> and I have to say I was very disappointed. The <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is very <phrase_Q=0.888>slow moving</phrase> ( don't get me wrong, I enjoy <phrase_Q=0.888>slow moving</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase>! ) , slow to the point of driving you crazy. All you hear is Julio Chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. This is a poorly made <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, but more importantly, it is a <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> without a lick of inspiration, I felt nothing for the story or its characters. "El Otro" was made only for the <phrase_Q=1.000>sake</phrase> of making a <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>... making it forgetful. I would advise you to <phrase_Q=1.000>pass</phrase> on this one, if you want to see good <phrase_Q=1.000>Argentinian</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase>, look for <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> by Sorin.
I grew up on this classic <phrase_Q=1.000>western</phrase> series, and as a child always considered it a treat being allowed to stay up late on Sunday evenings to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it. <phrase_Q=1.000>Bonanza</phrase> is still infinitely re watchable in re <phrase_Q=1.000>runs</phrase>. The series chronicles the adventures of the Cartwright <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase>, who <phrase_Q=1.000>live</phrase> on a <phrase_Q=1.000>ranch</phrase> near <phrase_Q=1.000>Virginia City</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Nevada</phrase> around the <phrase_Q=1.000>Civil War era</phrase>. Their <phrase_Q=1.000>ranch</phrase> ( called the Ponderosa ) is run and defended by the widowed father, Ben, and his unmarried three sons, <phrase_Q=1.000>Adam</phrase>, Hoss, and Little Joe. These three brothers have different mothers, all of whom have passed away <phrase_Q=0.781>years earlier</phrase>. The Cartwrights are a <phrase_Q=0.784>hard working</phrase>, prosperous, and honourable <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase>, highly respected in those parts. The Ponderosa is large so reaching its extremities requires a lot of horseback riding. Also, trips away are often necessary in <phrase_Q=1.000>order</phrase> to buy or sell <phrase_Q=1.000>cattle</phrase> and so forth. Needless to say, few of these excursions <phrase_Q=1.000>pass</phrase> uneventfully. Although hospitable, much of the Cartwrights' <phrase_Q=1.000>energy</phrase> must be spent defending their <phrase_Q=1.000>ranch</phrase> from interlopers, or protecting themselves from townsfolk jealous of their prosperity and <phrase_Q=1.000>stellar</phrase> reputation. The Cartwrights do a <phrase_Q=1.000>fair</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>bit</phrase> of firing their guns up in the air and such, but only shoot to kill when deemed absolutely necessary. They are involved in various <phrase_Q=1.000>town</phrase> affairs, even the <phrase_Q=1.000>political</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> of the <phrase_Q=1.000>Nevada territory</phrase>. One of the main assets of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present ( despite occasional disagreements ) between Ben and his three sons, and ( despite frequent disagreements ) between the three brothers. Now, one brother might beat up another every now and then, but generally has a good reason for it at the time and his anger never lasts <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase>! The characters are all very well drawn. Ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity. The oldest son, <phrase_Q=1.000>Adam</phrase>, the most rational and suave of the brothers, left midway through the series. The middle brother, Hoss, is a <phrase_Q=1.000>gentle giant</phrase> of a <phrase_Q=1.000>teddy bear</phrase>, who has an insatiable appetite for <phrase_Q=1.000>food</phrase> and is a little shy around the ladies. The youngest, Little Joe, is a <phrase_Q=0.853>hot headed</phrase>, handsome charmer who, by contrast, has quite a way with women. This trio of brothers enjoy various romances but their <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> interests are typically killed off by the end of the episode or else <phrase_Q=1.000>marriage</phrase> proves impossible, for whatever reason. The <phrase_Q=1.000>actors</phrase> are all <phrase_Q=1.000>stellar</phrase> in their roles, including <phrase_Q=1.000>Pernell Roberts</phrase> ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Adam</phrase> ) , <phrase_Q=1.000>Dan Blocker</phrase> ( Hoss ) , <phrase_Q=1.000>Michael Landon</phrase> ( Little Joe ) , and of course <phrase_Q=1.000>Lorne Greene</phrase> as the principled <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>patriarch</phrase>, Ben. I also <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> the <phrase_Q=1.000>ranch</phrase> cook, Hop Sing, played by <phrase_Q=1.000>Victor Sen Yung</phrase>. This is a wonderful <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase> packed <phrase_Q=1.000>western</phrase> with great values. The Cartwrights are always the noble heroes and most of the <phrase_Q=0.782>bad guys</phrase> quite villainous. If only there were more programs like this vintage <phrase_Q=1.000>western</phrase> on <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> these days!
Tenants Two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty <phrase_Q=1.000>apartment</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase>. They at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build. This is based upon a <phrase_Q=1.000>Bernard Malamud</phrase> novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel. Very little of the dialog is natural, its purple and brimming with shades of meaning. Its as if a <phrase_Q=1.000>college</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>English</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>major</phrase> with a head full of pretensions wrote the script. It's awful and I found myself instantly <phrase_Q=1.000>immune</phrase> to anything the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> had to say, which is a shame since the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is populated with <phrase_Q=1.000>great performances</phrase> from top to bottom. <phrase_Q=1.000>Snoop</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Dog</phrase> on down are fine form, unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premise. I can't really recommend this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. While not really bad, its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away. I <phrase_Q=1.000>lost</phrase> interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end. If you're interested I'd try it on <phrase_Q=1.000>cable</phrase>, but I wouldn't lay out good <phrase_Q=1.000>money</phrase> to see it.
This reminds me of when I was a born-again believer who was going to be a <phrase_Q=1.000>minister</phrase>. I never actually thought I would be a <phrase_Q=1.000>minister</phrase> or even graduate from <phrase_Q=1.000>high school</phrase> because I was almost positive I would be raptured to <phrase_Q=1.000>Heaven</phrase> before that would ever happen. That was before I discovered that <phrase_Q=1.000>Christianity</phrase> was a bunch rubbish. I am now an <phrase_Q=1.000>atheist</phrase>, and that just proves that the "once saved always saved" doctorine that <phrase_Q=1.000>Christians</phrase> tell us is no more real than elves. If it were true then why did I leave after many years of being a devout born again believer? Yes, I really was saved. I prayed that silly sinners <phrase_Q=1.000>prayer</phrase> with all my <phrase_Q=1.000>heart</phrase>. If <phrase_Q=1.000>Christians</phrase> were to read their <phrase_Q=1.000>Bible</phrase> they would discover that their <phrase_Q=1.000>god</phrase> thinks like <phrase_Q=1.000>rape</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>genocide</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>abortion</phrase>, and many other atrocities are alright according to him. They might be surprised to learn that no where is the word "<phrase_Q=1.000>rapture</phrase>" mentioned.
Ah, Bait. How do I hate thee? Let me <phrase_Q=1.000>count</phrase> the ways. 1. You try to be funny, but are corny and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to hurl. 2. You try to be dramatic, but are unbelievable; the woman overacts to a terrible <phrase_Q=1.000>degree</phrase>, and the "<phrase_Q=0.752>bad guy</phrase>" looks like Bill Gates, and is about as scary as...well, Bill Gates. ( Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. Doesn't work, does it? A <phrase_Q=1.000>lawyer</phrase>, maybe, but not a gun. Doesn't fit. ) As for <phrase_Q=1.000>Jamie Foxx</phrase>, well, just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous, and makes me want to hurl. 3. You try to be <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase>-packed, but instead are dull and dragging too many times. And when the <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase> heats up, the <phrase_Q=1.000>tripod</phrase> for the <phrase_Q=1.000>camera</phrase> must have been <phrase_Q=1.000>lost</phrase>, for the scenes wobble more than those in The <phrase_Q=1.000>Blair</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Witch</phrase> Project, and I find myself nauseated, and once again I want to hurl. 4. You try to be a good <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, but you failed, you FAILED, YOU FAILED! I would rather walk barefoot across the <phrase_Q=1.000>Sahara</phrase> with a pack full of <phrase_Q=1.000>beef</phrase> jerky and no <phrase_Q=1.000>water</phrase>, no <phrase_Q=1.000>sunscreen</phrase>, and only <phrase_Q=1.000>Meryl Streep</phrase> for <phrase_Q=1.000>company</phrase>. This hell would be lovelier than a <phrase_Q=1.000>single</phrase> minute more <phrase_Q=0.713>spent watching</phrase> everyone in Bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates for a <phrase_Q=0.752>bad guy</phrase>, and let's not even <phrase_Q=1.000>talk</phrase> about the massive bomb that goes off in a <phrase_Q=1.000>car</phrase> that Jamie Foxx's character has just driven OFF A CLIFF, but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I'll never have to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> a <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> that is this bad, ever again.
<phrase_Q=1.000>Oscar</phrase>-<phrase_Q=1.000>caliber</phrase> performance by <phrase_Q=1.000>Peter Falk</phrase> in an <phrase_Q=1.000>Oscar</phrase>-<phrase_Q=1.000>caliber</phrase>-written role. I loved the nuanced, balanced exploration of a <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase>-time <phrase_Q=1.000>marriage</phrase> - how often do we get that in <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase>, where usually the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> ends when boy & girl get together? This is a <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> for adults, a complex view through the eyes of all <phrase_Q=1.000>parties</phrase> - husband, wife, son - how each have adapted to each other in the past and grow during the story. On top of that, it gave me about 10 <phrase_Q=1.000>major</phrase> <phrase_Q=0.934>belly laughs</phrase>, and I'm one of those people who usually sits unamused when the rest of an audience is laughing. This was one of the few truly funny movies I've seen. Great, original jokes.
Pieced ( edited ) together from <phrase_Q=0.839>dead body</phrase> parts ( <phrase_Q=0.899>deleted scenes</phrase> ) from corpses ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Anchorman</phrase> ) , the <phrase_Q=1.000>Frankenstein Monster</phrase> ( Wake Up, <phrase_Q=1.000>Ron Burgundy</phrase> ) is definitely not a sight for sore eyes ( something you'd ever want to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> twice.....maybe even once for that <phrase_Q=1.000>matter</phrase>. ) More often than not -the <phrase_Q=1.000>relativity</phrase> of the scenes in WURB are made relevant by a third person narrator. Even more troubling is that the characters in WURB are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of <phrase_Q=1.000>Anchorman</phrase> ( in opening narration we're told WURB <phrase_Q=0.779>takes place</phrase> shortly after the original. ) At the end of <phrase_Q=1.000>Anchorman</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Burgundy</phrase> had grown since the start of the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> and embraced having a <phrase_Q=1.000>hybrid</phrase> co-anchorwoman/lover. In this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, he's back to his immature antics with prank <phrase_Q=0.952>phone calls</phrase> to Veronica ( quite clearly these are the more of the same scenes from the original <phrase_Q=1.000>Anchorman</phrase> spliced in to WURB. ) The part that makes this a <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, a continually evolving story, involves a <phrase_Q=1.000>bank</phrase>-robbing <phrase_Q=1.000>clan</phrase> without a cause called the <phrase_Q=1.000>Alarm Clock</phrase>. These scenes are almost painful to sit through. This part was scrapped from the original scripts for <phrase_Q=1.000>Anchorman</phrase>. The majority of other <phrase_Q=0.768>scenes involving</phrase> our <phrase_Q=1.000>Channel 4 news</phrase> team are clearly alternate/deleted takes on scenes from <phrase_Q=1.000>Anchorman</phrase>. They go to the same <phrase_Q=1.000>party</phrase> as in the original, the same original "group bitching about having a woman on the team" scene, and the same <phrase_Q=1.000>cat</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>fashion</phrase> show segment that Veronica had objections to reporting. <phrase_Q=1.000>Burgundy</phrase> re-creates their first date with the drive-in spot overlooking <phrase_Q=1.000>San Diego</phrase> and dinner at his favorite club, <phrase_Q=1.000>Tinos</phrase>. Neither character make mention that they've been to the drive-in spot before and when <phrase_Q=1.000>Burgundy</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>walks</phrase> into <phrase_Q=1.000>Tinos</phrase> with Veronica, he introduces it to her as though they've never been before. Oh, and they're wearing the same clothes as on their original date. Still, I have to give some credit to the filmmakers - even if WURB is nothing more than a clever way of presenting <phrase_Q=0.899>deleted scenes</phrase> tied together with narration. Between the two <phrase_Q=1.000>Ron Burgundy</phrase> stories - this is the weaker one. Looking back on it, it's quite a feat for <phrase_Q=1.000>Anchorman</phrase> to have risen from the ashes of WURB. You stay classy, <phrase_Q=1.000>IMDb</phrase>. Thanks for stopping by.
Let me start off by saying that this doesn't seem or feel like a <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. It seems like just another <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> show about popular girls and boys with no real <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>language</phrase> top back it up. The <phrase_Q=1.000>camera</phrase> angles are so <phrase_Q=0.914>straight forward</phrase> that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the <phrase_Q=1.000>public</phrase> connect with it. This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> takes us to where no <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> I've seen has done before: to a realm where the <phrase_Q=1.000>Film</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Theater</phrase> becomes a warm medium giving the <phrase_Q=1.000>public</phrase> every element of interpretation. Too obvious. The large <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> screen is only used as an enlarged <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> from where we can see every attribute of these women in a <phrase_Q=0.725>larger than life</phrase> manner. Lately it seems that young <phrase_Q=1.000>directors</phrase> are compromising the <phrase_Q=1.000>Art</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> making for sales. This is very scary. The <phrase_Q=1.000>industry</phrase> is spoiling the <phrase_Q=1.000>art</phrase> in movies. We must educate ourselves and our children about what <phrase_Q=1.000>cinematography</phrase> and its <phrase_Q=1.000>language</phrase> are really about. Not just sales and <phrase_Q=1.000>entertainment</phrase>, but a way to communicate feelings, <phrase_Q=1.000>passions</phrase> and even <phrase_Q=1.000>culture</phrase>. Not as a launching platform for <phrase_Q=1.000>young divas</phrase> and jocks.
Well, what can you say about <phrase_Q=1.000>sitcoms</phrase>. There often quite lame, <phrase_Q=1.000>morale</phrase> dedicative, and just plain. So is this show! It got a boring cast, although A.Bynes is okej in her perky way, the rest is just stereotypical crap....as always. We have all seen it before, and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled. Cause, lets face it, its a mediocre and self righteous show. As the most <phrase_Q=1.000>sitcoms</phrase> are.... Well, in <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase>. If you wanna see some good <phrase_Q=1.000>entertainment</phrase>, you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the <phrase_Q=1.000>mirror</phrase>. Do some faces and move on.... Its more entertaining than this show!
Well, if you are one of those Katana's <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>-nuts ( just like me ) you sure will appreciate this <phrase_Q=1.000>metaphysical</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Katana</phrase> swinging <phrase_Q=1.000>blood</phrase> spitting <phrase_Q=1.000>samurai</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase> flick. Starring <phrase_Q=1.000>Tadanobu Asano</phrase> ( Vital, Barren Illusion ) & Ryu Daisuke ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Kagemusha</phrase> ) . This <phrase_Q=1.000>samurai</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>war</phrase> between Heiki's <phrase_Q=1.000>clan</phrase> versus Genji's <phrase_Q=1.000>clan</phrase> touch the <phrase_Q=1.000>zenith</phrase> in the <phrase_Q=0.924>final showdown</phrase> at Gojo <phrase_Q=1.000>bridge</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=1.000>body-count</phrase> is countless. <phrase_Q=1.000>Demons</phrase>, magic swords, <phrase_Q=1.000>Shinto</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>priests</phrase> versus <phrase_Q=1.000>Buddhist</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>monks</phrase> and the beautiful visions provided by maestro <phrase_Q=1.000>Sogo</phrase> Ishii will do the rest. A good <phrase_Q=1.000>Japanese</phrase> flick for a rainy summer night.
There was a great <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> to be made about <phrase_Q=1.000>Steve Biko</phrase>. Sadly this wasn't it. <phrase_Q=1.000>Denzel Washington</phrase> - never the most flexible of <phrase_Q=1.000>actors</phrase> - is totally unable to convey the great charisma that <phrase_Q=1.000>Biko</phrase> had. Attenborough's big crowd scenes are laughable. The <phrase_Q=1.000>Soweto</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>massacre</phrase> wasn't like this, three neat lines of children ( some doing cartwheels! ) <phrase_Q=1.000>marching</phrase> happily into the guns of the soldiers. With <phrase_Q=1.000>Biko</phrase> dead the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> rapidly descends into <phrase_Q=1.000>farce</phrase>. If the struggle against <phrase_Q=1.000>Apartheid</phrase> was anything it was a <phrase_Q=1.000>black</phrase> people's struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a <phrase_Q=1.000>white</phrase> man and his <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase>. I'm sure <phrase_Q=1.000>Donald Woods</phrase> was a decent man and he would be the first to say that <phrase_Q=1.000>Biko</phrase> was important while he wasn't. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure <phrase_Q=1.000>Hampshire</phrase> and she seems completely unaware that she is in <phrase_Q=1.000>South Africa</phrase> at all. at all. The Wood's <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>dog</phrase> gets more lines than the <phrase_Q=1.000>black</phrase> maid. As the <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> make their escape one the women I saw the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> with - incidentally one of only about a dozen <phrase_Q=1.000>black</phrase> people in a large, full cinema - whispered "This is like the <phrase_Q=1.000>sound</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase>." She had a point. Overall this is a <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> by a well-intentioned if somewhat inept <phrase_Q=1.000>white</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>liberal</phrase> about a radical <phrase_Q=1.000>black</phrase> people's struggle. And really <phrase_Q=1.000>South Africa</phrase> needs well-intentioned <phrase_Q=1.000>white</phrase> liberals like it needs a hole in the head.
This one-minute <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is arguably the first <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> ever made. Other inventors had previously filmed actions - like Edison's motion <phrase_Q=1.000>photography</phrase> of a <phrase_Q=1.000>sneeze</phrase> - but the Lumiere brothers developed equipment that tremendously advanced the medium. At the time, of course, their `<phrase_Q=1.000>cinematograph</phrase>' must have bewildered their <phrase_Q=1.000>peers</phrase>, including their subjects. In this first instance, the brothers record employees leaving their <phrase_Q=1.000>factory</phrase>, some of whom understandably struggle to hide their awareness of the <phrase_Q=1.000>camera</phrase>. The Lumieres attempt to make the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> more entertaining by introducing animals and a <phrase_Q=1.000>bicycle</phrase>, but `La <phrase_Q=1.000>Sortie</phrase> Des Usines Lumiere' doesn't nearly match the ingenuity of their later <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase>. The most interesting <phrase_Q=1.000>aspect</phrase> of this <phrase_Q=1.000>short film</phrase> is the brothers' selection of a familiar <phrase_Q=1.000>working class</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>ritual</phrase> as their subject. Their choice is the initial evidence of their curiosity about all of the world's people, a quality that makes viewing their experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating today. Rating: 8
A <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> has rarely left me as cold as this one. There is not a <phrase_Q=1.000>bit</phrase> of tension, not a second of fear, not a moment we jump, even a little <phrase_Q=1.000>bit</phrase>. The girl is cute, yeah. That's it. Was that worth a <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> ? I knew it wasn't supposed to be a great <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, but I was at least expecting one.
The 1990's begun to have day time <phrase_Q=1.000>talk shows</phrase> sprout up left and right. Every network had one, and they all lacked one thing Originality. Ricky <phrase_Q=1.000>Lake</phrase> was just another show to entertain the <phrase_Q=1.000>obese</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>trailer park</phrase> mother with a Marlboro <phrase_Q=1.000>cigarette</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>hanging</phrase> out of her <phrase_Q=1.000>mouth</phrase> while <phrase_Q=1.000>breast feeding</phrase> one of her dozens of toothless, illiterate children. The <phrase_Q=1.000>English language</phrase> and other cornerstones of mankind where ruined by this shows existence. Titltes ranging from Girl you a Pigeon Head and so on. How could anyone want to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> this pure and <phrase_Q=0.864>utter garbage</phrase>? Has our <phrase_Q=1.000>society</phrase> really became nothing more than a bunch of hill billy's and dead beat fathers? The people who appear on this show were Trash. The people who watched this show were Trash. Anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto <phrase_Q=1.000>DVD</phrase> is TRASH. People wonder why <phrase_Q=1.000>Americans</phrase> are becoming huge piles of <phrase_Q=1.000>lard</phrase> and too <phrase_Q=1.000>fat</phrase> to even get jobs, its having shows like this tell them Its <phrase_Q=1.000>OK</phrase> to be 500lbs overweight, and have 12 year old girls <phrase_Q=1.000>act</phrase> like <phrase_Q=1.000>prostitutes</phrase>. Having such trash on <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> has ruined morals.
I used to <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> watching "Sabrina, the <phrase_Q=0.950>Teenage Witch</phrase>" Friday nights on ABC's TGIF. I think this was one of the best shows on TGIF. My <phrase_Q=1.000>friends</phrase> and I used to get together every Friday just to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> this show and we never missed an episode. My favorite character was <phrase_Q=1.000>Salem</phrase>. He was adorable and sooo funny. I liked Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey, too. He was HOT. I think <phrase_Q=1.000>Melissa Joan Hart</phrase> played a good <phrase_Q=0.950>teenage witch</phrase>, too. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina Through the Looking <phrase_Q=1.000>Glass</phrase>" and "Hilda and <phrase_Q=1.000>Zelda</phrase>: the <phrase_Q=0.818>Teenage Years</phrase>". Those episodes were great. Overall I really miss this show. I hope one day <phrase_Q=1.000>ABC</phrase> brings it back with new episodes. I give this show 10/10 <phrase_Q=1.000>stars</phrase>.
This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> has some things that are pretty amazing. First, it is supposed to be based on a <phrase_Q=0.700>true story</phrase>. That, in itself, is amazing that multiple <phrase_Q=1.000>tornadoes</phrase> would hit the same <phrase_Q=1.000>town</phrase> at night in the fall-in <phrase_Q=1.000>Nebraska</phrase>. I wonder if the real town's name was close to "Blainsworth" ( which is the town's name in the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> ) . There is an Ainsworth, <phrase_Q=1.000>Nebraska</phrase>, but there is also a <phrase_Q=1.000>town</phrase> that starts with Blains-something. It does show the slowest moving <phrase_Q=1.000>tornadoes</phrase> on record in the the seen where the boys are in the <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase>. On the other hand, the scene where the <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> goes fuzzy is based in fact. Before <phrase_Q=1.000>Doppler radar</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>weather radio</phrase>, we were taught that if you turned your <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> to a particular <phrase_Q=1.000>channel</phrase> ( not on <phrase_Q=1.000>cable</phrase> ) and tuned the brightness just right, you could tell if there was a <phrase_Q=1.000>tornado</phrase> coming. The problem was that by then you would be able to hear it. Since I know something about <phrase_Q=1.000>midwest</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>tornadoes</phrase>, it made this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> fun for me. I enjoy it more than Twister. I mean, give me a break-there is no way you could make it through and F5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase>.
For those of you who've never heard of it ( or seen it on <phrase_Q=1.000>A&E</phrase> ) , Cracker is a brilliant <phrase_Q=1.000>British</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> show about an overweight, <phrase_Q=1.000>chain-smoking</phrase>, foulmouthed <phrase_Q=1.000>psychologist</phrase> named Fitz who helps the <phrase_Q=1.000>Manchester</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>police</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>department</phrase> get into the heads of violent criminals. It's considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of <phrase_Q=1.000>England</phrase> ( and that's saying something ) , and was tremendously successful in <phrase_Q=1.000>England</phrase> and around the world back in 1993. Now, the original <phrase_Q=1.000>stars</phrase> have re-teamed with the original <phrase_Q=1.000>writer</phrase> to knock out one more 2-hour episode. I've loved this show ever since I'd first seen it, over a <phrase_Q=0.899>decade ago</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=1.000>DVD</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>box set</phrase> holds a place of honor in my collection, and I can quote a good deal of Fitz's interrogation scenes practically word for word. The idea of <phrase_Q=1.000>Robbie Coltrane</phrase> reteaming with <phrase_Q=1.000>Jimmy McGovern</phrase> for another <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> about Fitz filled me with absolute <phrase_Q=1.000>glee</phrase>. I'll start with the good. One of the many things that impressed me about the original Cracker series was how quickly Fitz was defined as a character. Five minutes into the first episode  with his lecture ( throwing the books into the air ) , his drinking, and his cussing of the guy after him on the <phrase_Q=1.000>gambling</phrase> machine queue  and you knew, simply knew, who this character was. You could feel him "clicking" in your mind, the kind of click that only happens when a great <phrase_Q=1.000>actor</phrase> gets a great role written by a great <phrase_Q=1.000>writer</phrase>. <phrase_Q=1.000>Coltrane</phrase>, of course, remained great throughout the show, but I always felt that some of the later episodes  those not written by <phrase_Q=1.000>McGovern</phrase>  mistreated the character. So the good <phrase_Q=1.000>news</phrase> is this: Fitz is back. As soon as you see him in this show  making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughter's <phrase_Q=1.000>wedding</phrase>  you'll feel that "click" once again. It's him: petulant one moment and truly sorry the next, always insightful, sincere to the point of tactlessness but brilliantly funny in the process. If you <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> this character as much as I do, you'll be delighted with how he is portrayed in the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. And this extends to Judith and Mark: in fact, everything having to do with the Fitzs is handled perfectly. The problem I do have with this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> revolves around the <phrase_Q=1.000>crime</phrase> Fitz is trying to solve. In standard Cracker <phrase_Q=1.000>fashion</phrase>, we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes  the <phrase_Q=1.000>suspense</phrase> lies in seeing Fitz figure it out. In this case, we have a <phrase_Q=1.000>serial killer</phrase> who is out for <phrase_Q=1.000>American</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>blood</phrase>. And the reason for this, unfortunately, is not due to any believable <phrase_Q=1.000>psychological trauma</phrase>  rather, it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the <phrase_Q=1.000>writer</phrase> to display his personal <phrase_Q=1.000>political</phrase> beliefs. It's difficult for me to write this, as I truly believe that <phrase_Q=1.000>Jimmy McGovern</phrase> is one of the greatest writers in the world. Nor do I have a problem with movies that are about current issues, or movies that take a <phrase_Q=1.000>political</phrase> stand. But in the Cracker <phrase_Q=1.000>universe</phrase>, we expect to see the characters behaving like <phrase_Q=1.000>human</phrase> beings, not like <phrase_Q=1.000>caricatures</phrase>. Instead, the <phrase_Q=1.000>Americans</phrase> in this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical <phrase_Q=1.000>fashion</phrase>. They're know-nothing loudmouths who complain about everything, treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives  one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than 5 minutes. I honestly thought I'd mistakenly switched channels or something. But it doesn't stop there. We get constant reminders of just how badly the <phrase_Q=1.000>war</phrase> in <phrase_Q=1.000>Iraq</phrase> is going  reminders that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere. The killer is so busy ranting about how <phrase_Q=1.000>Bush</phrase> is worse than <phrase_Q=1.000>Hitler</phrase> that he almost forgets to get on with the killing; but more to the point, he is such a mouthpiece for the writer's <phrase_Q=1.000>political</phrase> views that he forgets to <phrase_Q=1.000>act</phrase> like a believable <phrase_Q=1.000>human</phrase> being, and thus we  as an audience  don't buy his sudden transformation from a happy <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> man to a tortured serial-killing <phrase_Q=1.000>soul</phrase>. I can't say that this ruined the show for me  it's was still good <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase>, better than almost everything else in the <phrase_Q=1.000>genre</phrase> ( mainly due to, once again, <phrase_Q=1.000>Coltrane</phrase> ) . But its constant politicizing made it impossible for it to be as good as the real Cracker <phrase_Q=1.000>classics</phrase> like "To Be A Somebody"  an episode that was just as "issuey", but one that was handled with far more subtlety and <phrase_Q=1.000>psychological</phrase> depth. Two other small points: <phrase_Q=1.000>Panhandle</phrase> not being around is a disappointment, but what's worse are her replacements. The entire <phrase_Q=1.000>police</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>department</phrase>  which for so <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase> filled with such great characters - is now full of <phrase_Q=1.000>vanilla</phrase>. Completely interchangeable cops who lack any and all personality ( how you could drain Coupling's <phrase_Q=1.000>Richard Coyle</phrase> of personality is beyond me, but it is indeed missing here ) . Also, there are couple of moments where the show <phrase_Q=1.000>lost</phrase> its believability for me. One such instance revolves around Fitz having to narrow down the entire <phrase_Q=1.000>population</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>Manchester</phrase> from 1 million to a hundred based on some very strange criteria ( <phrase_Q=1.000>French</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>windows</phrase>? How does the computer know if I have <phrase_Q=1.000>French</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>windows</phrase>? )  he not only succeeds in doing this, but he succeeds in less than an hour. I don't think so. So, all in all, I was a little disappointed. It's recommended viewing, but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door. Still, if there's new series to come after this, it would all have been for the good: I'm convinced that <phrase_Q=1.000>McGovern</phrase> can still write great stuff, and maybe now that he's got his <phrase_Q=1.000>politics</phrase> out of his system he can go back to writing about people.
As a <phrase_Q=1.000>biographical film</phrase>, "The Lady With <phrase_Q=1.000>Red</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Hair</phrase>" ( the story of how <phrase_Q=1.000>director</phrase> /<phrase_Q=1.000>producer</phrase>/<phrase_Q=1.000>playwright</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>David Belasco</phrase> transformed notorious <phrase_Q=1.000>society</phrase> divorcee Mrs. Leslie Carter into an international stage <phrase_Q=1.000>star</phrase> ) is certainly not in <phrase_Q=1.000>a league</phrase> with that other Warner's <phrase_Q=1.000>biopic</phrase> of similar vintage, "<phrase_Q=1.000>Yankee Doodle Dandy</phrase>" ( what is? ) , but "Lady" is an enjoyable <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> in its own right--AND shares quite a few traits in common with the Cagney classic. Like "<phrase_Q=1.000>Yankee Doodle Dandy</phrase>," "The Lady With <phrase_Q=1.000>Red</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Hair</phrase>" brims over with old -time show-<phrase_Q=1.000>business</phrase> flavor. ( Among other things, both <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> feature delicious theatrical <phrase_Q=1.000>boarding-house</phrase> sequences as well as the inevitable scenes set backstage and in theatrical managers' offices. ) Also, in "Lady" as in the Cohan <phrase_Q=1.000>biopic</phrase>, the <phrase_Q=0.803>supporting cast</phrase> is made up of familiar and beloved character <phrase_Q=1.000>actors</phrase> of the <phrase_Q=1.000>period</phrase>, all doing the sort of top-notch work we remember them for. Need I add that, again like "<phrase_Q=1.000>Yankee Doodle Dandy</phrase>," "The Lady With <phrase_Q=1.000>Red</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Hair</phrase>" doesn't let the truth get in the way of telling a good story? But, also like "<phrase_Q=1.000>Dandy</phrase>," "Lady" does manage--gloriously!--to convey the esssence of its show-<phrase_Q=1.000>business</phrase>-giant hero's <phrase_Q=0.725>larger-than-life</phrase> personality. Everyone knows that Cagney limned Cohan for all time in his brilliant and affectionate portrayal in "<phrase_Q=1.000>Yankee Doodle Dandy</phrase>"--but few moviegoers realize that <phrase_Q=1.000>Claude Rains</phrase> did a similar service for <phrase_Q=1.000>David Belasco</phrase> in "The Lady With <phrase_Q=1.000>Red</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Hair</phrase>"- -and did it with a panache that almost equals Cagney's. Rains-as-<phrase_Q=1.000>Belasco</phrase> perfectly captures that legendary showman's galvanic personality in all its outsized glory. Rains gives a tremendously enjoyable , superbly observed, and remarkably true-to-<phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> performance as the man all <phrase_Q=1.000>Broadway</phrase> once called "The Wizard." To <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Claude Rains</phrase> in <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase> ( looking in every <phrase_Q=1.000>shot</phrase> as if he's having a helluva good time! ) in "The Lady With <phrase_Q=1.000>Red</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Hair</phrase>" is to see <phrase_Q=1.000>David Belasco</phrase> leap to <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> on <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> as if he can't wait to shake things up on the <phrase_Q=1.000>Main Stem</phrase> once again.
One would think ( as I did ) , that with <phrase_Q=1.000>Steve Martin</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Goldie Hawn</phrase>, and <phrase_Q=1.000>John Cleese</phrase>, a <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> should be, at the very least, decent. These <phrase_Q=1.000>stars</phrase> ( especially Martin and Cleese ) have <phrase_Q=1.000>produced</phrase> some of the funniest works of <phrase_Q=1.000>comedy</phrase> of all time. Well, apparently I was grossly mistaken--this is <phrase_Q=1.000>single</phrase>-handedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny. It pained me to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> these <phrase_Q=0.783>talented actors</phrase> execute one of the most positively lame scripts I have had the misfortune to come across. Based solely on the <phrase_Q=0.833>big names</phrase>, I remained hopeful for a <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase> time through the duration of the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, but it consistently failed to provide any <phrase_Q=1.000>entertainment</phrase> whatsoever. Normally, both with movies and in <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase>, I try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations. But with this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, it's hard not to let loose. I can <phrase_Q=1.000>count</phrase> on one hand, perhaps even two or three fingers, <phrase_Q=1.000>major</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Hollywood</phrase> productions that left me more bitter than this. This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made. I tried to enjoy this---I really did. But The Out-of-Towners ultimately <phrase_Q=0.936>fails miserably</phrase>. If you really want time-efficient <phrase_Q=1.000>entertainment</phrase>, just take your <phrase_Q=1.000>money</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it swirl as you flush it down the toilet. Just please don't <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>.
Maria Braun got married right in the middle of combat all around her and her husband Hermann. An explosion ripped through the building, to begin with, and she and Hermann had to sign the papers on a pile of <phrase_Q=1.000>rubble</phrase> on the street. Perhaps this may <phrase_Q=1.000>strike</phrase> some as a <phrase_Q=0.927>heavy-handed</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>metaphor</phrase> for what's about to come: <phrase_Q=1.000>marriage</phrase> on the rocks, so to speak. It's a betrothal where the husband goes off to <phrase_Q=1.000>war</phrase> and is held in a <phrase_Q=1.000>Russian</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>prison</phrase> camp, unbenownst to the helpless but hopeful and proud Maria, who keeps standing by the depressing <phrase_Q=1.000>rubble</phrase> of the <phrase_Q=1.000>train station</phrase> as some come home, others don't, with a sign awaiting Hermann. Trouble arises, as happens in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's <phrase_Q=1.000>melodramas</phrase>, and as its one of his best and most provocative, we see as Maria ( uncommonly gorgeous <phrase_Q=1.000>Hanna Schygulla</phrase> in this role ) will do a <phrase_Q=1.000>two-face</phrase>: she'll stand by her man, even if it means working at a bar for <phrase_Q=1.000>American</phrase> GI's and, even still after she hears from a <phrase_Q=1.000>fellow</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>soldier</phrase> that Hermann has died will still stand by him as she sleeps with a <phrase_Q=1.000>black</phrase> GI and comes close to bearing his child ( that is, naturally, until he reappears and a <phrase_Q=1.000>murder</phrase> occurs and he takes the <phrase_Q=1.000>rap</phrase> so she can be safe ) , or working for a <phrase_Q=1.000>German</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>businessman</phrase> ( effectively sympathetic <phrase_Q=1.000>Ivan Desny</phrase> ) and becoming his sometimes mistress and rising <phrase_Q=1.000>star</phrase> in the <phrase_Q=1.000>company</phrase>. Maria will do whatever it takes to be successful, but she'll always be married. It's hard to say there's anything about Maria that isn't fascinating. <phrase_Q=1.000>Money</phrase>, sex, power, all of these become interchangeable for Maria. She's like the <phrase_Q=1.000>feminist</phrase> that has her <phrase_Q=1.000>cake</phrase> and eats it with a sultry smile: she gets to have a husband, more or less ( actually a lot less until the last ten minutes of the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> ) while obtaining things- a man who dotes on her whenever he can, a new and expensive <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase> with servants, a <phrase_Q=1.000>secretary</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>money</phrase>- that others around her aren't getting due to already being with a man or too weak in a position to rise anywhere ( such as the <phrase_Q=1.000>secretary</phrase>, played interestingly enough by Fassbinder's own mother ) . Maria is sexy, confident, and all alone, with an idealized <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> going against a <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> that should be made in the shade. She says of the two men- the <phrase_Q=1.000>American</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>soldier</phrase> and poor old and sick Oswald- that she's fond of them, and at the same time will stick by those roses the confused and <phrase_Q=1.000>soul</phrase>-searching husband Hermann sends from <phrase_Q=1.000>Canada</phrase>, after being released from <phrase_Q=1.000>prison</phrase>. She's casts a profile that a <phrase_Q=1.000>feminist</phrase> would <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> to trounce, but understand where she's coming from and going all the way. <phrase_Q=1.000>Fassbinder</phrase> employs this inherent contradiction, and moments with Maria appear to go against the conventions of a <phrase_Q=1.000>melodrama</phrase> ( for example, Hermann walking in on the jubilant and <phrase_Q=0.869>half-naked</phrase> Maria and GI is just about a masterpiece of a scene, with Maria's <phrase_Q=1.000>reaction</phrase> not of surprise or guilt but pure happiness to see that he's there let alone alive ) , while sticking to his guns as a <phrase_Q=1.000>director</phrase> of such <phrase_Q=1.000>high</phrase>-minded technique with a storyline that should be predictable. But it isn't really. It's like one big <phrase_Q=1.000>metaphor</phrase> for a <phrase_Q=1.000>country</phrase> that, after the <phrase_Q=1.000>war</phrase>, couldn't really move on to normalcy. A few times <phrase_Q=1.000>Fassbinder</phrase> puts <phrase_Q=1.000>sound</phrase> of the <phrase_Q=1.000>radio</phrase> on in the background, and we see Maria walking around her <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase>, hustle and bustle going on around her, and the <phrase_Q=1.000>radio</phrase> speaks of a divided <phrase_Q=1.000>Germany</phrase>, of things still very unsettled, of a disarray. Maybe the only way to cope is excess, or maybe that's just my interpretation of it. It's hard to tell, really, under Schygulla's stare face and eyes, anyway. It's such an incredible performance, really, one of those showstoppers that captures the glamor and allure of an old-time <phrase_Q=1.000>Hollywood</phrase> female <phrase_Q=1.000>star</phrase> while with the down-and-dirty ethic of a girl of the streets. Most telling are the opposing costumes one sees in one scene when she finally is with her husband, where she <phrase_Q=1.000>stars</phrase> in one of those super-lustful <phrase_Q=1.000>black</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>lingerie</phrase> pieces and <phrase_Q=1.000>high</phrase> heels, and then moves on to a dress without even thinking about it. That's almost the essence of what Maria is, and Schygulla wonderfully gets it down, a headstrong but somehow loving figure who is adored and perplexed by the men around her, sometimes in a <phrase_Q=1.000>single</phrase> sentence. This is what <phrase_Q=1.000>Fassbinder</phrase> captures in his wonderful first part of his "<phrase_Q=1.000>trilogy</phrase>"; while I might overall prefer Veronika <phrase_Q=1.000>Voss</phrase> as a masterpiece, Maria Braun is perhaps just as good as a <phrase_Q=0.857>character study</phrase>, of what makes a woman <phrase_Q=1.000>tick</phrase> and tock with ( almost ) nothing to lose.
<phrase_Q=1.000>Homelessness</phrase> ( or Houselessness as <phrase_Q=1.000>George Carlin</phrase> stated ) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered <phrase_Q=1.000>human</phrase> who did everything from going to <phrase_Q=1.000>school</phrase>, work, or vote for the <phrase_Q=1.000>matter</phrase>. Most people think of the <phrase_Q=1.000>homeless</phrase> as just a <phrase_Q=1.000>lost</phrase> cause while worrying about things such as <phrase_Q=1.000>racism</phrase>, the <phrase_Q=1.000>war</phrase> on <phrase_Q=1.000>Iraq</phrase>, pressuring kids to succeed, <phrase_Q=1.000>technology</phrase>, the elections, <phrase_Q=1.000>inflation</phrase>, or worrying if they'll be next to end up on the streets. But what if you were given a <phrase_Q=1.000>bet</phrase> to <phrase_Q=1.000>live</phrase> on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home, the <phrase_Q=1.000>entertainment</phrase> sets, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you once treasure to see what it's like to be <phrase_Q=1.000>homeless</phrase>? That is Goddard Bolt's lesson. <phrase_Q=1.000>Mel Brooks</phrase> ( who directs ) who <phrase_Q=1.000>stars</phrase> as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a <phrase_Q=1.000>bet</phrase> with a sissy rival ( Jeffery Tambor ) to see if he can <phrase_Q=1.000>live</phrase> in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings. The bet's on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can't step off the sidewalk. He's given the <phrase_Q=1.000>nickname</phrase> Pepto by a <phrase_Q=1.000>vagrant</phrase> after it's written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Lesley Ann Warren</phrase> ) an ex-<phrase_Q=1.000>dancer</phrase> who got <phrase_Q=1.000>divorce</phrase> before losing her home, and her pals <phrase_Q=1.000>Sailor</phrase> ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Howard Morris</phrase> ) and Fumes ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Teddy Wilson</phrase> ) who are already used to the streets. They're survivors. Bolt isn't. He's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it's fight or flight, kill or be killed. While the <phrase_Q=1.000>love connection</phrase> between Molly and Bolt wasn't necessary to plot, I found "<phrase_Q=1.000>Life Stinks</phrase>" to be one of <phrase_Q=1.000>Mel Brooks</phrase>' observant <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> where prior to being a <phrase_Q=1.000>comedy</phrase>, it shows a tender side compared to his <phrase_Q=1.000>slapstick</phrase> work such as <phrase_Q=1.000>Blazing Saddles</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Young Frankenstein</phrase>, or <phrase_Q=1.000>Spaceballs</phrase> for the <phrase_Q=1.000>matter</phrase>, to show what it's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid <phrase_Q=1.000>bet</phrase> like all rich people do when they don't know what to do with their <phrase_Q=1.000>money</phrase>. Maybe they should give it to the <phrase_Q=1.000>homeless</phrase> instead of using it like <phrase_Q=1.000>Monopoly</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>money</phrase>. Or maybe this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> will inspire you to help others.
One of the things that interested me most about this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is the way the characters and their associated histories are developed on the <phrase_Q=1.000>fly</phrase>. I suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not <phrase_Q=1.000>force feeding</phrase> their characters. The premise of using the <phrase_Q=1.000>art</phrase> and craft of <phrase_Q=1.000>furniture</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>design</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>construction</phrase> was a unique theme and/or analogy for what families/siblings go through in <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase>. The complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> emotionally interesting. Also, although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to ( i.e. <phrase_Q=1.000>Jewish</phrase>/<phrase_Q=1.000>twins</phrase>/<phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>business</phrase> ) the themes are fairly <phrase_Q=1.000>universal</phrase> as every <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> has a <phrase_Q=1.000>black</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>sheep</phrase> in it. That made it very engaging.
Every once in a while , someone out of the <phrase_Q=1.000>blue</phrase> looks at me a little <phrase_Q=1.000>sideways</phrase> and asks "What's with SNITCH'D" ? I know immediately they have a case of barely-hidden <phrase_Q=1.000>amusement</phrase> + <phrase_Q=1.000>horror</phrase>. You see, I was the <phrase_Q=1.000>cinematographer</phrase> on the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. Let me clarify some points regarding this "interesting <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> experience". Originally, SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July of 1999, a day after I wrapped <phrase_Q=1.000>TRIANGLE</phrase> SQUARE, a great little 35mm feature that like so many <phrase_Q=1.000>indie</phrase> features of the <phrase_Q=1.000>era</phrase> never got distribution despite <phrase_Q=1.000>festival</phrase> accolades...it <phrase_Q=1.000>fell</phrase> eternal victim to the <phrase_Q=1.000>fine print</phrase> of SAG's notorious <phrase_Q=1.000>Experimental</phrase> Feature <phrase_Q=1.000>contract</phrase>. But I digress... I though I was on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot his little <phrase_Q=1.000>gangster</phrase> flick in 16mm with a <phrase_Q=1.000>shooting</phrase> budget of about $25,000, not wanting to break pace, I took it. After all, CLERKS, <phrase_Q=1.000>EL MARIACHI</phrase>... I too believed the myth back then. Let's just <phrase_Q=1.000>chalk</phrase> it up as "<phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>school</phrase>" for many involved, myself included. SNITCH'D was <phrase_Q=1.000>shot</phrase> over two weeks in August, 1999, in <phrase_Q=1.000>Aliso Viejo</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>Santa Ana</phrase>, CA. Cahill taught <phrase_Q=1.000>Drama</phrase> at a <phrase_Q=1.000>High School</phrase> in the latter <phrase_Q=1.000>city</phrase> ( yes, he is a <phrase_Q=1.000>Drama</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>English</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>teacher</phrase>...consider THAT while watching the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, or even observing the use of <phrase_Q=1.000>apostrophe</phrase> in title ) , hence the locations and cast. Of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of L.A.'s <phrase_Q=1.000>Channel</phrase> 2 Morning <phrase_Q=1.000>News</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>weather</phrase> girl Vera Jimenez, and of greater impact, the debut of <phrase_Q=1.000>Eva Longoria</phrase>, who had just arrived in <phrase_Q=1.000>Hollywood</phrase> and was as eager as I to get a <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> under her belt. I must say her <phrase_Q=1.000>professional</phrase> dedication, focus and "let's do this" attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom-yet-to-come. SNITCH'D suffered from poor <phrase_Q=1.000>optics</phrase>, few lights or <phrase_Q=1.000>electricity</phrase>, several boom operators du jour, and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication. None of that overshadows the actual content, which speaks for itself. Anyway, by 2003, the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> was sold to distributors ( at a net loss, I understand ) who inexplicably had no photos of Eva on the box ( by then she was a rising, working name ) but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic <phrase_Q=1.000>Latino</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>gangster</phrase> to lend credibility to SNITCH'D. Since Cahill's other passion is <phrase_Q=1.000>antiquarian</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>book</phrase> dealing, it appears to confirm he believes you can, in fact, <phrase_Q=1.000>judge</phrase> a <phrase_Q=1.000>book</phrase> by it's <phrase_Q=1.000>cover</phrase>... as so many have picked up this <phrase_Q=1.000>DVD</phrase> based on it's sleeve. ----------------- One year later, Eva, now on a <phrase_Q=1.000>soap</phrase>, and I met James for one day to shoot a simple <phrase_Q=1.000>short film</phrase> he had concocted, <phrase_Q=1.000>SPLIT</phrase> SECOND, which I think has never seen any <phrase_Q=1.000>play</phrase> despite <phrase_Q=1.000>festival</phrase> intent. 6 years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> titled JUAREZ, <phrase_Q=1.000>Mexico</phrase>. I though he had worked out the process; my participation was contingent on casting, script and crew control, and the resultant <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> actually looked promising in dailies, for what it was... a cheap <phrase_Q=1.000>detective</phrase> story surrounding the <phrase_Q=1.000>mass</phrase> murders of girls in Juarez; despite claims here and elsewhere, the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> has NEVER appeared in any <phrase_Q=1.000>festival</phrase> or venue, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the <phrase_Q=1.000>DVD</phrase> release of two studio pictures on the same subject, <phrase_Q=1.000>VIRGIN</phrase> OF JUAREZ and BORDER <phrase_Q=1.000>TOWN</phrase>.
I had some reservations about this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, I figured it would be the usual bill of fare --- a formula <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> about <phrase_Q=1.000>Christmas</phrase>. Being in the middle of a <phrase_Q=1.000>heat wave</phrase> in late June, we decided to give it a <phrase_Q=1.000>shot</phrase> anyway, maybe we would see some <phrase_Q=1.000>snow</phrase>. This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> turned out to be one laugh after another. <phrase_Q=1.000>Ben Affleck</phrase> was believable in his character, but the real <phrase_Q=1.000>star</phrase> of this one is James Gandofini. He delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great "dad". If you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours, definitely check this one out.
The only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for <phrase_Q=1.000>free</phrase> at <phrase_Q=1.000>college</phrase>. And if a <phrase_Q=1.000>college</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>student</phrase> can't find humor in something that was <phrase_Q=1.000>free</phrase>, it's hopeless. Stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent, yet bewildering <phrase_Q=0.885>set design</phrase> ( that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon <phrase_Q=1.000>Beetles</phrase> ) . I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, but I have never seen anything more depressing. This was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch ( which has its opponents, but I enjoyed it very much ) . It's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it. You want a funny Seuss adaptation? Go with the Grinch.
Probably the worst <phrase_Q=1.000>Bollywood film</phrase> I've seen. No <phrase_Q=0.750>plot line</phrase>. Very little character developments. Full of silly and pointless humor. The whole <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> was chaotic and direction-less. There was no proper ending to the story. The <phrase_Q=1.000>airport</phrase> was filmed in a <phrase_Q=1.000>shopping mall</phrase>. Same story chewed over and over again until you want to say "please, just move on with it!!" Even the <phrase_Q=1.000>song</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>dance</phrase> was pointless and badly choreographed. The only good thing about this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is that there were hot bods all around... but then most of the <phrase_Q=1.000>Bollywood</phrase> movies have that anyways these days. Btw I'm not from an <phrase_Q=1.000>Indian</phrase> background 2/10
***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** A hunchback 15-year-old boy kisses a very cute 15-year-old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time. After the <phrase_Q=1.000>act</phrase>, he lays in the bed with her not touching her. The next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years. This is seemingly a fine opening for a <phrase_Q=1.000>teleplay</phrase> about a boy discovering his <phrase_Q=1.000>homosexuality</phrase>, or perhaps a <phrase_Q=1.000>medical drama</phrase> about a post-pubescent teen with a severe <phrase_Q=1.000>hormone</phrase> deficiency. However, as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a 15-year-old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother. At one point, his mother preaches to her co-workers who are not as understanding as they might be, "Every step of the way in this, my son has been amazing... I have never been more proud of him..." The young father's <phrase_Q=0.886>older sister</phrase>, who otherwise is cold towards her brother, begins to show pride in her sibling, "You have been cool about this," as she gives him an encouraging warm hug. The 15-year-old father wants to be a father. He wants to be a parent. Why not? We see the "new" baby a few minutes after birth -- it appears to be a healthy, happy 4-month-old <phrase_Q=1.000>infant</phrase>. Just as babies were born on <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> in the 1960's and 1970's. Once the young father is a parent, he has found happiness. He insists he will be the one to change the dirty <phrase_Q=1.000>diaper</phrase>. We see the 15-year-old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the teen's busy=body mother is peaking over his shoulder. Fade to <phrase_Q=1.000>black</phrase>.
Yuck. I thought it odd that their ancient <phrase_Q=1.000>book</phrase> on curses was made using a common script <phrase_Q=1.000>font</phrase> instead of hand written. The acting is so apathetic at times and so over-dramatic at other times. Why would a "demonico" kill the two suspiciously quiet <phrase_Q=1.000>doctors</phrase> who helped make him immortal? Just for the heck of it? And is it really necessary to show Lilith's <phrase_Q=1.000>motorcycle</phrase> whenever she's out somewhere. We get it! You spent a little <phrase_Q=1.000>bit</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>money</phrase> to rent some <phrase_Q=1.000>third rate</phrase> crotch <phrase_Q=1.000>rocket</phrase>. It doesn't mean you have to show it all the time! The "Faith's" lair looks like an old <phrase_Q=1.000>school</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Battlestar Galactica</phrase> set with some last minute changes. There is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a <phrase_Q=1.000>talk</phrase> show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance. Everyone is a throwaway character. Forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill-conceived movies I've seen the <phrase_Q=1.000>SciFi</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>channel</phrase> come out with. Stay away unless you're into bad movies.
I just don't get some of the big premises of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable, and that there's anything so ugly it would make you insane. Someone here made the remark that maybe it's the <phrase_Q=1.000>frequency</phrase> of the <phrase_Q=1.000>light</phrase> waves or something rather than it being ugliness. Miranda is just a <phrase_Q=1.000>jerk</phrase>. The episode is slow, inconsistent and way too talky. I also don't quite understand why Kolos is an <phrase_Q=1.000>ambassador</phrase> - why doesn't the Federation just leave the damn Medusans be? There's one part I do like, when Kolos is speaking through <phrase_Q=1.000>Spock</phrase> about the loneliness of the <phrase_Q=1.000>human</phrase> experience. Overall, I <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> TOS and even at its lamest, I'll always tune in. This episode though - mmm, I wouldn't purchase it except for a used copy under $3.
I gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes... this is definitely really about a 5.5..... Ummm.. it was kind of bloody, had likeable, shallow characters, and it had some really hot babes in it. I like the eclectic killer, because he didn't kill people the same way <phrase_Q=1.000>everytime</phrase>... that sometimes gets old.
I think the <phrase_Q=0.775>biggest disappointment</phrase> in this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> was that, right until the end, I expected the acting instructors of the cast to break in and apologize for how poor the acting was. When you consider the powerful subject, the brilliant scenery and the effort made in creating a wonderful set and spectacular images, it is a shame that little attention was given to acting.
When <phrase_Q=1.000>Paris</phrase> is Burning came out, I totally dismissed it. I was not into the whole <phrase_Q=1.000>Madonna</phrase> and vogueing phenomenon. I thought it was going to be campy and silly. How wrong I was about this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. I watched it after the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> had been out for ten years and I ran out and bought it. It took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement. I felt as though I knew all of the characters personally. The 80s were spectacular and the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> captured the essence of the <phrase_Q=1.000>gay</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>culture</phrase>. What a <phrase_Q=0.743>terrific job</phrase>! I went on the <phrase_Q=1.000>internet</phrase> and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but I have not been able to locate all of them. If any one has any <phrase_Q=1.000>information</phrase> on any of the casts members please let me know. I hope they make another <phrase_Q=1.000>documentary</phrase>. I LOVED IT
Always enjoy great <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> which deal with the super-natural and the deep thoughts of the Spiritual world. However, this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> just turned me off as far as its <phrase_Q=1.000>production</phrase> and direction. There is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell; all I can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the <phrase_Q=0.772>big screen</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=1.000>actors</phrase>, namely: <phrase_Q=1.000>Mark Addy</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Thomas Garrett</phrase>, gave an outstanding performance in his <phrase_Q=1.000>native</phrase> land <phrase_Q=1.000>England</phrase>, and we have seen him in "Still Standing" a <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> Series. <phrase_Q=1.000>Heath Ledger</phrase>, played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in "<phrase_Q=1.000>Brokeback Mountain</phrase>",'05, gave a great <phrase_Q=0.824>supporting role</phrase>. Shannyn Sossaman, ( Mara Sinclair ) , did a good job of seducing a <phrase_Q=1.000>priest</phrase> from a <phrase_Q=1.000>church</phrase> not recognized by any <phrase_Q=1.000>faith</phrase>. Don't waste your time, you will be sorry!
Leon was fantastic as always, this time playing Little Richard in his early years. The <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> showed a fully fleshed out Little Richard without neglecting to fill the show with lots of great <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase>. My only complaint is that the ending was a little abrupt - I was hoping for a 2-parter!
First off, anyone who thinks this <phrase_Q=1.000>sequel</phrase> to William Friedkin's "The <phrase_Q=1.000>French Connection</phrase>", is <phrase_Q=1.000>superior</phrase> is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both. The problem with reviewing this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is that, a. ) it's a <phrase_Q=1.000>sequel</phrase> to a brilliant <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, which always makes watching it objectively difficult, and b. ) it's <phrase_Q=1.000>directed</phrase> by John Frankenhimer, one of the best <phrase_Q=1.000>American</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>directors</phrase> ever, so I wanted to like it. William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct a <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> about <phrase_Q=1.000>drug</phrase> traffic in decaying new <phrase_Q=1.000>York city</phrase>, because of his <phrase_Q=1.000>documentary</phrase>-like approach to the <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase> and story, Frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish <phrase_Q=1.000>directors</phrase> ever, i.e. "The <phrase_Q=0.993>Manchurian Candidate</phrase>" and "Seconds", and with his "<phrase_Q=1.000>French Connection</phrase> 2" it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off. That fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the <phrase_Q=1.000>sequel</phrase> by <phrase_Q=1.000>Gene Hackman</phrase> himself really tells a lot about Hackman's understanding about the original <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> too. It's well known Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again, it's also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional, loosing weight and trying to <phrase_Q=1.000>play</phrase> him like a straight character. it shows you Hackman, despite being a great <phrase_Q=1.000>actor</phrase>, had no idea who to make the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> and the story great. The plot point of Doyle becoming an addict is interesting, but doesn't warrant the rest of the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. An unfortunate <phrase_Q=0.738>low point</phrase> in Frankenhimer's filmography.
<phrase_Q=1.000>Curly Sue</phrase> is a 6 year old with an abundance of <phrase_Q=1.000>hair</phrase> and a <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> as a drifter. She and her father, Bill ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Jim Belushi</phrase> ) , try to survive on the streets by being small time con artists. In <phrase_Q=1.000>Chicago</phrase>, Bill decides to jump in front of a <phrase_Q=1.000>car</phrase> in a pricey parking <phrase_Q=1.000>garage</phrase> while Curly will scream about lawsuits and traction to the intended victim. It happens to be a very upscale <phrase_Q=1.000>lawyer</phrase> named Grey ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Kelly Lynch</phrase> ) who is appropriately appalled at what she has done. Not only do the scammers make some cash, they get to spend the night at Grey's <phrase_Q=1.000>plush</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>apartment</phrase>. Even then, Grey feels she owes them more so the three of them hang together for a spell. Grey only knows the lucrative <phrase_Q=1.000>law</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>business</phrase> and nothing about <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase>. Who better to teach her than Bill and Curly, those savvy experts on life's realities? But, all good things must come to an end and there is no <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> for a legal expert and a couple of con men. Or is there? This is a sweet and funny <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> about the unexpected. Curly is certainly as entertaining as <phrase_Q=1.000>Shirley Temple</phrase> but much edgier, of course. Belushi gives a rare touching performance as the down on his luck con and Lynch is luminous as the snooty but soft touch <phrase_Q=1.000>lawyer</phrase>. <phrase_Q=0.981>John Hughes</phrase>, as <phrase_Q=1.000>writer</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>director</phrase>, shows us his magic touch once again, as the script is lively and unpredictable. Just <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> Curly and Bill take Grey out for a night, with no <phrase_Q=1.000>money</phrase>, and see the humorous <phrase_Q=1.000>results</phrase>. Do you <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase> for <phrase_Q=1.000>happy endings</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase> promised and finally delivered, with a few uncertain moments in between? This is your made-to-<phrase_Q=1.000>order</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>.
So, I know that I voted 1 out of 10 but really this deserves no more than half of a <phrase_Q=1.000>star</phrase>. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can't believe any of the <phrase_Q=1.000>stars</phrase> signed on to make this ridiculously absurd project. James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were excellent in their characters and <phrase_Q=1.000>Ben Affleck</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>Christina Applegate</phrase> were just as good too, but the story sucked and I encourage anyone who sees this in the <phrase_Q=1.000>video</phrase> store to not even bother picking it up and <phrase_Q=1.000>reading</phrase> the back <phrase_Q=1.000>cover</phrase>, but to just walk away...I don't even want to get into what the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is about, because it is too stupid to pontificate about. Don't rent this! It's horrible! Horrible!
Story about four <phrase_Q=0.919>teenage girls</phrase> growing up in <phrase_Q=1.000>California</phrase>. Jeanie ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Jodie Foster</phrase> ) is the most level-headed of the bunch--but wants to move out of her <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase> where she lives with her divorced mother ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Sally Kellerman</phrase> ) . Annie ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Cherie Currie</phrase> ) is addicted to <phrase_Q=1.000>drugs</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>alcohol</phrase> and bad boys and is beaten up by her father. Madge ( Marilyn <phrase_Q=1.000>Kagan</phrase> ) has overprotective parents. Deirde ( Kandice <phrase_Q=1.000>Stroh</phrase> ) thinks she's more mature than the rest of them. This is nothing new from what we've seen plenty of times before--but this one has one big difference--it's accurate. I graduated from <phrase_Q=1.000>high school</phrase> in 1980 ( when I first saw the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> ) and I was surprised at how realistic it was. They got the dialogue, clothes and attitudes down completely right. Even the main <phrase_Q=1.000>song</phrase> of the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> ( "On the <phrase_Q=1.000>Radio</phrase>" by <phrase_Q=1.000>Donna Summer</phrase> ) was a <phrase_Q=0.809>big hit</phrase> before this came out. This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> hit me harder than any other <phrase_Q=1.000>teen film</phrase> of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters. I knew girls in <phrase_Q=1.000>high school</phrase> who were just like this! The <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is ( of course ) dated but it captures a time we will never see again. The acting is good on all counts with Foster giving the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman ( who was excellent ) was realistic and well-done. Even <phrase_Q=1.000>Scott Baio</phrase> ( who has a <phrase_Q=0.772>small role</phrase> as a friend of the girls ) more or less realistically played a teen boy. A very good <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>--<phrase_Q=0.870>essential viewing</phrase> if you came of age in 1980. The <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> has a deserved R rating ( plenty of <phrase_Q=1.000>drug</phrase> use and swearing ) but should be seen by all teens. I give it a 8.
This 2003 made for <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> was shown on a women's <phrase_Q=1.000>channel</phrase>, naturally. As a man, why do I even attempt to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> this? I don't know, but I should have my head examined. And <phrase_Q=1.000>director</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>writer</phrase> Simon Gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does. He takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in. Number one bore is <phrase_Q=1.000>Joyce</phrase> Hyser as the wife. I couldn't wait for him to drop her. Her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. The other <phrase_Q=1.000>femme fatale</phrase> was Nichole Hiltz, about the coldest person you'd ever want to meet. Her looks didn't warrant our <phrase_Q=1.000>leading man</phrase> to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious, only a fool could miss. Definitely a loser. Tembi <phrase_Q=1.000>Locke</phrase> was pretty good, but slow on the uptake as to the <phrase_Q=1.000>slut</phrase> seducing her own husband, again played as a guy who is a loser, by <phrase_Q=1.000>David DeLuise</phrase>. Rounding out our cast of losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our <phrase_Q=1.000>hero</phrase>. Stephen Jenkins as our <phrase_Q=1.000>hero</phrase>, or should I say victim, was not that good. At first I thought he just a bad <phrase_Q=1.000>actor</phrase>, but later I believed it. He never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout. Although, as a man, I became enraged when the two women got away with it. Men, beware of this <phrase_Q=1.000>channel</phrase> that puts men down and women get away even with <phrase_Q=1.000>murder</phrase>. LMN is the <phrase_Q=1.000>channel</phrase>. Beware. Note: Having watched this a second time by mistake, I am convinced on my initial thoughts. Especially on the <phrase_Q=1.000>writer</phrase>/<phrase_Q=1.000>director</phrase>, Simon Gornick. I still believe he has disgraced the male <phrase_Q=1.000>species</phrase> and should be <phrase_Q=1.000>horse</phrase> whipped. Only <phrase_Q=0.969>saving grace</phrase> in this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is Tembi <phrase_Q=1.000>Locke</phrase> who doesn't have a chance to show her talents with the awful acting of Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise around her. Plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse. Down with Gornick's <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> and his vacant <phrase_Q=1.000>stars</phrase> in it. Please LMN don't show this trite again.
The number of times I've had tears in my eyes when watching a <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> are few. And there is only one time when I have really cried and that was when I saw this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> has some kliches but I really don't care. I cry even as I write this and it was quite some time since I saw it. It is perfectly acted and all the <phrase_Q=1.000>production</phrase> values are good, but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message. We all know it in our <phrase_Q=1.000>hearts</phrase>, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> is <phrase_Q=1.000>LOVE</phrase> in all it's forms. It's only when we <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> that we're truly alive. I know how sentimental I <phrase_Q=1.000>sound</phrase> and I promise I'm not usually like that. I'm quite a cynic. This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> has brought out stronger feelings of both sorrow and happiness in me than any other movies and it will probably always be the first <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> I recommend others to see.
This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. It's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the <phrase_Q=0.825>plot outline</phrase>. This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is agonizingly slow and I was bored for almost all 98 minutes. While the acting is mediocre at best, the <phrase_Q=0.846>biggest problem</phrase> is the script, which is <phrase_Q=0.873>poorly written</phrase>, slow and plodding with no real direction. Occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event. I'm not surprised that the <phrase_Q=0.714>entire cast</phrase> was sick and throwing up between shots, they did after all have to try and digest a terrible script. As a <phrase_Q=0.811>huge fan</phrase> of good <phrase_Q=1.000>horror movies</phrase>, I'm always irritated that something this bad gets made. Save yourself 98 minutes you'll never get back.
From the very beginning I was so excited to see this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=1.000>poster</phrase> is possibly the funniest I've ever seen for a <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. I immediately bought one for my dorm this September. Every element came together in this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> so beautifully. It's not often you see a <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> with so many <phrase_Q=1.000>penis</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>gay</phrase>, and racial jokes so praised by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally. Carell remains sweet throughout the entire <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> where by the end of the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> you're rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid. The <phrase_Q=0.803>supporting cast</phrase> is brutal, each of them having some problems with the ladies themselves. One of the things about this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is the abundance of memorable scenes we're given. This is what makes a <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> easy to remember fondly. This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> will often be brought up when the words "chest waxing" and "<phrase_Q=1.000>condoms</phrase>" are mentioned in conversation. Watching it in the <phrase_Q=1.000>theater</phrase> I was surprised how many older people were there to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it. I saw a group of four mid-60s women come in. Despite an older audience, this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> still filled the entire <phrase_Q=1.000>theater</phrase> with laughter. I think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the Office and <phrase_Q=1.000>Steve Carell</phrase>. A lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes you'd see on <phrase_Q=1.000>Family Guy</phrase>, too. The <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and clever enough for <phrase_Q=0.910>middle aged</phrase> women. I don't recommend going to this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> if you aren't a fan of <phrase_Q=1.000>profanity</phrase> or if you are <phrase_Q=0.915>easily offended</phrase>. However, when you are at the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, just remember this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is all in good humor. The jokes aren't "<phrase_Q=1.000>gay</phrase> jokes," they're just jokes. And they're funny.
It's very very funny. You know, just like a <phrase_Q=1.000>comedy</phrase> is supposed to be. It also looks very very good, like a <phrase_Q=1.000>Hollywood</phrase> Spectacular should. So, what more do you want? Howz about a very VERY good Sally Fields. She is so much better here than in anything else I've ever seen her in, and she looks so damn good. This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is all you need to understand why she's a <phrase_Q=1.000>Star</phrase>. Those eyes! Like a <phrase_Q=1.000>silent movie</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>star</phrase>, but better. In fact, everyone's eyes are so good. I used to pretend to be a bad <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>soap</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>actor</phrase> with my girlfriend. We'd do that thing where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner. They don't do that at all in <phrase_Q=1.000>Soap</phrase> Dish. Great. The Eyes Have It! ( sorry ) There's so many <phrase_Q=0.732>terrific performances</phrase>, its fun just waiting for each of them to reappear. There's a whole workshop going on with <phrase_Q=1.000>Kevin Kline</phrase> on how to Overact very very subtly. Got that? Yeah, he's damn good. So is <phrase_Q=0.993>Robert Downey</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Jr</phrase>. who has since made sumthin of a career of playing the Slick, Slimy Executive. Cathy Moriarity, while not the most gifted <phrase_Q=1.000>actress</phrase>, is so charismatic and riveting, especially when she's angry. And even <phrase_Q=1.000>Whoopi Goldberg</phrase> is decent, her natural timing giving here somewhat flat delivery a little Zing. <phrase_Q=1.000>OK</phrase>, no <phrase_Q=1.000>Whoopi</phrase> Bashing, I hear ya. And then, there's the <phrase_Q=1.000>Hair</phrase>. <phrase_Q=1.000>Soap</phrase> Dish was made at the end of the <phrase_Q=1.000>BIG Hair</phrase> Eighties, so the ridiculous doos are like a great character in themselves. They get bigger and sillier, just like your's did. Yeah, we got pictures. <phrase_Q=1.000>Soap</phrase> Dish is better than I thought it'd be, better that I wanted it to be. I'm sick of Movies that tell me I'm supposed to care about shallow, self centered, semi-talented egomaniacs, ie. <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Soap</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Actors</phrase>. <phrase_Q=1.000>Soap</phrase> Dish seems happy just to have me laugh at 'em. Thank You.
Another review likened this troupe to a cross between <phrase_Q=1.000>Monty Python</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>Twin Peaks</phrase>, also aptly. Yet another review expounded on the differences between the <phrase_Q=1.000>comedy</phrase> we enjoy non-critically and <phrase_Q=1.000>black comedy</phrase>, also well worth consideration. <phrase_Q=1.000>Watch</phrase> the whole thing, all three series. At the end, all the characters are tied up and the <phrase_Q=1.000>puzzle</phrase> pieces fall into place just as well as a <phrase_Q=1.000>Douglas Adams</phrase> novel. The detail and intricacies are staggering. Thoroughly <phrase_Q=0.909>post-modern</phrase>. <phrase_Q=0.814>Wickedly funny</phrase>, and startlingly tragic. Not for kids. Not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity. <phrase_Q=0.892>Thought-provoking</phrase>. At once literal, figurative, and surreal in disturbing ways. The blackest <phrase_Q=1.000>comedy</phrase> I can recall. And very possibly the most wonderful thing I will ever see.
Well I just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that I'll never get back on this piece of trash. I heard someone online describe this movie's villains as "subhuman cannibals", and I thought it was promising because I thought it would be like the Descent. WRONG! The Descent was a <phrase_Q=1.000>psychological thriller</phrase> with dynamic characters and strong storyline. These villains are <phrase_Q=0.819>totally unrealistic</phrase> and no part of their performance is enjoyable to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase>. This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> isn't so controversial, I've seen this level of <phrase_Q=1.000>gore</phrase> in many <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase>. This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> plain sucks. SYNOPSIS: A blonde who thinks she's real hot ( but she isn't ) , her admirer, and her admirer's friend ( no, I don't remember their names ) go into the woods. Their <phrase_Q=1.000>car</phrase> breaks down. They are warned to leave by a <phrase_Q=0.724>man named</phrase> Mark. The blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they can't find the admirer's friend. Admirer impales his foot ( whoops! ) . Don't worry, he is much more upset when his <phrase_Q=1.000>car</phrase> won't start than when he gets impaled by nails. After a <phrase_Q=1.000>nanosecond</phrase> of coaxing, the blond <phrase_Q=1.000>leaves</phrase> to find help. Events ensue that I cannot remember. During this and throughout the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, we are shown <phrase_Q=1.000>grotesque</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>torture</phrase> scenes with no substance including one that made me gag. Blonde goes to save admirer from <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase> of cannibals ( even though all they are seen eating is intestines, which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual <phrase_Q=1.000>food</phrase> ) . Blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard ( unsuccessfully ) to work up tears. Then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase> and announces she can "out think them". Mark ( the man who warned them to leave ) has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase>. Then there is some <phrase_Q=1.000>shooting</phrase>, they leave the <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase>, the <phrase_Q=1.000>shooting</phrase> continues, then a random guy shows up and says he's been watching them. Before he is <phrase_Q=1.000>shot</phrase>, we are shown an <phrase_Q=1.000>acid</phrase>-trip inspired scene of more killing. The blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them. There's more killing, the admirer professes his <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> for the blonde. Then a mysterious hand covers the <phrase_Q=1.000>camera</phrase>. What does that imply? I don't know, hopefully not a <phrase_Q=1.000>sequel</phrase>.
In this <phrase_Q=0.785>extremely low-budget</phrase> ( I've seen <phrase_Q=1.000>home movies</phrase> made with better <phrase_Q=1.000>production</phrase> value ) <phrase_Q=1.000>Australian</phrase> utter rip-off of "the Burning" & "Friday the 13th", a <phrase_Q=1.000>band</phrase> is planning to make a <phrase_Q=1.000>music video</phrase> while on a <phrase_Q=1.000>houseboat</phrase>. They're stalked by a <phrase_Q=1.000>serial killer</phrase> who was burned years before. This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is even proclaimed to be 'the worst <phrase_Q=1.000>Australian</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> ever made' in it's <phrase_Q=1.000>DVD</phrase> promotional material. That's it's only <phrase_Q=0.729>selling point</phrase>! Complete and <phrase_Q=0.891>utter rubbish</phrase> in every considerable way. Perhaps a few <phrase_Q=1.000>chuckles</phrase> here and there for bad <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> lovers, but it still made me want to burn out my retinas. <phrase_Q=0.951>Eye Candy</phrase>: a quick <phrase_Q=1.000>flash</phrase> of barely existent itty bitty titties in a lame <phrase_Q=0.863>shower scene</phrase> My Grade: F
You know this is gonna be a cheesy <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> when: 1. It was made it the 50's 2. It's in <phrase_Q=1.000>black</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>white</phrase>. 3. It has no name <phrase_Q=1.000>actors</phrase>! 4. Screaming makes up for the lack of <phrase_Q=1.000>special effects</phrase>! Well not to be outdone - this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> brilliantly incorporated all four of the above elements to turn this into a true cinematic blunder. Okay - shhhhh but I am gonna discuss <phrase_Q=1.000>special effects</phrase> here - or lack of them - Did you catch the underwater scenes? It looks like it was poorly filmed through an <phrase_Q=1.000>aquarium</phrase> - note the cape flapping in the breeze. And the repeated re-use of <phrase_Q=1.000>Stock Footage</phrase>, ( exterior <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase> shots, the bridges scenes -- great enhanced the K-R-A-F-Tiness of this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> - not since "<phrase_Q=1.000>PLAN 9</phrase>" - have I seen such creative usage of <phrase_Q=1.000>stock footage</phrase>. And hey where there was a lack of <phrase_Q=1.000>special effects</phrase> - not to worry - screaming DOES take the place of <phrase_Q=1.000>special effects</phrase> in this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> as well. Yes this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> even cleverly used that old hack trick. Grab the <phrase_Q=1.000>popcorn</phrase> - set your <phrase_Q=1.000>brain</phrase> on stun ( several fermented beverages DEFINITELY helps ) , sit back, and wonder: why the heck did they put this on <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> again? Wayno
Sorry, but aside from <phrase_Q=1.000>Kim Basinger</phrase> doing a good job acting scared, this was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in awhile. <phrase_Q=1.000>Logic</phrase> is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded <phrase_Q=1.000>mall</phrase> then shoot a <phrase_Q=1.000>security</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>guard</phrase>. Yet no one seems to notice. Then, instead of screaming for help or racing back to the <phrase_Q=1.000>mall</phrase>, she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit. I can't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thugs, carrying a <phrase_Q=1.000>red</phrase> toolbox, screaming for <phrase_Q=1.000>God</phrase> to come help her, and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others. Please trust me, this is bad and a <phrase_Q=1.000>bit</phrase> tasteless as well.
On the surface, "Show Me The <phrase_Q=1.000>Money</phrase>" should have at least finished a full <phrase_Q=1.000>season</phrase>. You had the always entertaining <phrase_Q=1.000>William Shatner</phrase> as your host, surrounded by a baker's dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called "The <phrase_Q=0.967>Million Dollar</phrase> Dancers." You had knowledgeable contestants who had interesting stories to tell of their lives and who presumably knew a lot of <phrase_Q=1.000>pop culture</phrase> trivia. And you had big <phrase_Q=1.000>money</phrase>! So, what went wrong? The format of this <phrase_Q=1.000>game</phrase> was the failure. A good <phrase_Q=1.000>game</phrase> show needs at least two of three things: very simple rules, exciting pacing and the ability for the viewer to <phrase_Q=1.000>play</phrase> along at home. The best, most enduring ones have all three. Unfortunately, SMTM had none. The rules for this <phrase_Q=1.000>game</phrase> were among the most complex of any prime time <phrase_Q=1.000>game</phrase> show in <phrase_Q=1.000>history</phrase>. Let me try to explain how the <phrase_Q=1.000>game</phrase> worked, as briefly as possible. A contestant began with a <phrase_Q=1.000>single</phrase> word or <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase> phrase followed by the choice letters A, B, C ( subtle plug for the network? ) . Each letter was connected to a separate question, all starting with that word or phrase. Once a contestant chose one of the letters, they could either answer that question or <phrase_Q=1.000>pass</phrase> and select a second letter. If they passed, they got to view the next question, and had the same option. However, if they passed the second question, they were required to answer the third option. After they answered and before they found out if their answer was correct, they then had to select one of the 13 dancers on stage, each with a different amount of <phrase_Q=1.000>money</phrase> in a scroll by their side. They revealed their dollar amount ( ranging from $20,000 to $250,000 ) and depending on if the contestant answered right... or answered wrong... that amount would be added to or subtracted from their pot. Still with me so far? In addition, there was one <phrase_Q=1.000>dancer</phrase> who held something known as "The Killer <phrase_Q=1.000>Card</phrase>." If you selected the <phrase_Q=1.000>dancer</phrase> with the Killer <phrase_Q=1.000>Card</phrase> and you had gotten your question right, you were safe, and the <phrase_Q=1.000>game</phrase> continued. If, however, you were incorrect, you had one final question to answer. If you got that final question wrong, you were out of the <phrase_Q=1.000>game</phrase>. If you got it right, then, the <phrase_Q=1.000>game</phrase> continued. There was no quitting, no walking away with the <phrase_Q=1.000>money</phrase> earned until you either answered six questions correctly or got six questions wrong or you were so far in the hole you couldn't earn enough <phrase_Q=1.000>money</phrase> to get back out. Got it? Okay! The <phrase_Q=0.846>biggest problem</phrase>, as I saw it, was a <phrase_Q=0.811>complete lack</phrase> of tension, because of the <phrase_Q=1.000>design</phrase> of the <phrase_Q=1.000>game</phrase>. A contestant could <phrase_Q=1.000>pass</phrase> questions they knew they didn't know, and answer many questions they did know, making the <phrase_Q=1.000>pressure</phrase> even less. Then, they could still find a low dollar amount, even after knowingly missing a question, which meant there still wasn't any "<phrase_Q=1.000>drama</phrase>." And the fact that they could answer five questions wrong and still have a chance to win was a <phrase_Q=0.867>big mistake</phrase>. And the pacing of the questions was deadly slow: often the questions were so obvious, it was ridiculous to try to create tension, as if there was any doubt about some of the most common answers. The pacing, the lack of any real tension at any point during the show and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working, despite Shatner's terpsichorean talents.
A <phrase_Q=1.000>Chinese</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Ghost Story</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>stars</phrase> the late, great <phrase_Q=1.000>Leslie Cheung</phrase> as <phrase_Q=0.951>Ling Choi Sin</phrase>, a penniless <phrase_Q=1.000>tax</phrase> collector who decides to spend the night at a deserted <phrase_Q=1.000>temple</phrase>, where he meets and <phrase_Q=1.000>falls</phrase> for a <phrase_Q=0.746>beautiful woman</phrase> called Tsing ( Joey Wang ) . When Ling discovers that Tsing is actually a <phrase_Q=1.000>ghost</phrase> who has been forced to seduce victims for an evil <phrase_Q=1.000>tree</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>spirit</phrase> who feeds on 'chi' ( <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> force ) , he decides to try and <phrase_Q=1.000>free</phrase> the girl by giving her remains a proper <phrase_Q=1.000>burial</phrase>. Enlisting the help of Swordsman Yin ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Wu ma</phrase> ) , a crazy <phrase_Q=1.000>Taoist</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>monk</phrase>, Ling successfully defeats the <phrase_Q=1.000>tree</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>spirit</phrase>, but must also do battle in hell against the evil <phrase_Q=1.000>Lord</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Black</phrase>, to whom Tsing is due to be wed. The first <phrase_Q=1.000>Hong Kong</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> that I saw which wasn't purely <phrase_Q=1.000>martial arts</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase>, A <phrase_Q=1.000>Chinese</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Ghost Story</phrase> opened my eyes to the incredible world of <phrase_Q=1.000>Asian</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>fantasy</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>horror</phrase>, a magical realm inhabited by beautiful female ghosts, bumbling innocent heroes, <phrase_Q=1.000>sword</phrase> wielding <phrase_Q=1.000>Taoist</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>monks</phrase>, monstrous spirits, and dark <phrase_Q=1.000>lords</phrase> of the <phrase_Q=1.000>underworld</phrase>; I instantly <phrase_Q=1.000>fell</phrase> in <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> with the film's exuberance, <phrase_Q=1.000>energy</phrase>, humour, inventiveness and visual excellence. Two decades later, and this amazing <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> still remains one of the finest examples of its <phrase_Q=1.000>genre</phrase> that I have seena sumptuous, breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly blends <phrase_Q=1.000>horror</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>comedy</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>fantasy</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>romance</phrase>. With superb direction from <phrase_Q=0.967>Siu-Tung</phrase> Ching, excellent <phrase_Q=1.000>editing</phrase> from <phrase_Q=1.000>David Wu</phrase>, <phrase_Q=0.743>stunning cinematography</phrase>, and a whole slew of imaginative <phrase_Q=1.000>special effects</phrase> ( including a humongous killer <phrase_Q=1.000>tongue</phrase>, a many tentacled monster, and multiple flying heads! ) , A <phrase_Q=1.000>Chinese</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Ghost Story</phrase> is a completely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish.
I already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a <phrase_Q=1.000>satire</phrase>, there were numerous <phrase_Q=1.000>political</phrase> and social messages, the names make refer to some other names etc. It might be. I cannot realize such things ( I don't want to do anyway ) because I am not interested in, I am interested in 'cinema'. As for the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> itself, again it is said that the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is clever and dramatically powerful. I could not see anything which we don't see in monster movies except the scene which <phrase_Q=0.779>takes place</phrase> in a office in the second half. Yes, that scene says somethings about humanity, but it does not make the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> brilliant. The <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is entertaining ( mildly ) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. As for the <phrase_Q=0.861>biggest flaw</phrase> of the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, it is <phrase_Q=1.000>visual effects</phrase>. It was just shocking, I could not pull myself together for a while, because I had expected a realistic monster, because it is not one of the old <phrase_Q=1.000>Gojira</phrase> movies, it was made in 2006, but it was not. It is like if you don't believe that there is a monster, you cannot care about. If you agree with me about this, I <phrase_Q=0.804>highly recommend</phrase> you <phrase_Q=1.000>Cloverfield</phrase> that is extremely realistic. The <phrase_Q=1.000>design</phrase> of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. Dramatically powerful critique. Some critics <phrase_Q=1.000>talk</phrase> about it as if it is a <phrase_Q=1.000>Kurosawa</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. Yes, it is rather a <phrase_Q=1.000>drama</phrase> than a <phrase_Q=1.000>thriller</phrase> or <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase>, but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. I don't want to compare The Host with other monster movies, but I try to mean that The Host does not do something that other monster movies do not do. By the way, may be some people call the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> masterpiece because of their sympathy for <phrase_Q=1.000>Asian</phrase> cinema. Yes, I like <phrase_Q=1.000>Asian</phrase> cinema too, but this is the fact.
This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is one of those <phrase_Q=1.000>nostalgia</phrase> things with me and I never REALLY expect anyone else to "get it" but am pleased when I recommend it and somebody DOES enjoy it. My late father HATED <phrase_Q=1.000>Arthur Askey</phrase> but this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for "The <phrase_Q=1.000>Ghost</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Train</phrase>" and "Old Ted 'Olmes" transferred to me as a child. Years later, I <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it every now and again, enjoying the familiarity. I always wonder if it will not be quite the same but I am never disappointed in it. There is much to enjoy. The <phrase_Q=1.000>sequence</phrase> on the <phrase_Q=1.000>train</phrase> is truly inspired when Askey and <phrase_Q=1.000>Murdoch</phrase> proceed to annoy the arrogant male passenger. Then the whole section in the <phrase_Q=1.000>station</phrase> is amazing with so much going on you have to keep up. Yes, it is dated and full of <phrase_Q=1.000>wartime</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Britishness</phrase> in accents and plot ( based on the original <phrase_Q=1.000>play</phrase> by <phrase_Q=1.000>Arnold Ridley</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>Dad's Army</phrase> fame! ) but full of wonderful character performances - including <phrase_Q=1.000>Kathleen Harrison</phrase> as a dotty <phrase_Q=1.000>spinster</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=1.000>atmosphere</phrase> is truly as near sinister as an <phrase_Q=1.000>Arthur Askey</phrase> vehicle could get. This is available cheap as chips in the <phrase_Q=1.000>UK</phrase> on <phrase_Q=1.000>DVD</phrase> so treat yourself. It is a perfect Saturday/<phrase_Q=0.918>Sunday morning</phrase> or any day lazy afternoon <phrase_Q=1.000>lightweight</phrase> piece of <phrase_Q=1.000>entertainment</phrase>. I Thank You.... OLD MOVIES CAN BE GOOD MOVIES!
First off, I would like to point out that the reason why I gave this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> 1 <phrase_Q=1.000>star</phrase> out of 10 is because there is no option to give it NO <phrase_Q=1.000>stars</phrase>! it really is that bad! I was never eager to see this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> after I saw the ads for it, I ended up seeing it only by chance because some <phrase_Q=1.000>friends</phrase> of mine had tickets and had one spare so I tagged along. Before seeing it I had a fairly good idea that it wouldn't be genius - the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it, but at the back of my mind I was thinking "but there must be something good about it for <phrase_Q=1.000>UMA THURMAN</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>Luke Wilson</phrase> do to the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>..." not that I think either of them are particularly terrific but they are big-named <phrase_Q=1.000>stars</phrase> who would normally only do <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> that would enhance their reputations. However, about 10-20 minutes into the feature I realized that the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> was probably worse than I had at first anticipated. I was shocked at how terrible the script was. It really gave the <phrase_Q=1.000>actors</phrase> NOTHING to work with, so much so that they really looked like they didn't know what they were doing ( especially <phrase_Q=1.000>Luke Wilson</phrase> ) . The story was <phrase_Q=0.753>completely predictable</phrase> - if you've seen the <phrase_Q=1.000>ad</phrase> then you've pretty much seen the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>! And there was nothing original about it - it pretty much borrows from every '<phrase_Q=1.000>super-hero</phrase>' story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> been set up as a <phrase_Q=1.000>satire</phrase> of that <phrase_Q=1.000>genre</phrase>, but alas it wasn't. The direction seemed to be of realism. I got the feeling that the <phrase_Q=1.000>director</phrase> wanted the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> to feel completely realistic and not <phrase_Q=1.000>satire</phrase> at all, and yet there were some moments in the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a <phrase_Q=1.000>satire</phrase>. At one moment in the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like "Oh well, she's dead...time to move on" and he says it in such a droll voice that it completely didn't make any sense. I found myself checking my <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> after about 40 minutes to see how much longer I would have to sit through it. And then it struck me...I began to think "I wonder if the studio have made this picture as a <phrase_Q=1.000>test</phrase> to see if they can make the worst possible <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> ever made, and still pull a large audience..." I couldn't think of any other reason why this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> would be made. For movies to be made these days, the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the <phrase_Q=1.000>production</phrase> stage...I can't comprehend how this one got past the first draft stage... By the end, and exceedingly, dumb-founding-Ly stupid climax, I was laughing heartily - just not at what the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>-makers wanted me to laugh at, but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> was. Thank <phrase_Q=1.000>God</phrase> I didn't have to <phrase_Q=0.778>pay money</phrase> to see it...because that would have really annoyed me!!! Oh, and could I just add, that of the two Wilson brothers, I have always preferred <phrase_Q=1.000>Luke</phrase> because I think he is a better, more versatile <phrase_Q=1.000>actor</phrase>...but if he wants to step even further into OWEN's shadow then this is exactly the way to do it...I doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of 2 hours!!! and remember, it only got a generous 1/10 because I couldn't select 0!
This is an amazing <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> or show young people. Aside from a very brief <phrase_Q=0.834>nude scene</phrase>, it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in <phrase_Q=1.000>Africa</phrase> that you'll rarely find in other <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase>. It does <phrase_Q=1.000>bear</phrase> a superficial similarity to OUT OF <phrase_Q=1.000>Africa</phrase>, but without all the <phrase_Q=1.000>romantic</phrase> fluff. The <phrase_Q=1.000>White</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>French</phrase> people in <phrase_Q=1.000>Cameroon</phrase> are fascinating because they don't even seem to regard the natives as people. The Whites are all the bosses and they expect <phrase_Q=1.000>Black</phrase> servitude without question. However, unlike real servants, you only once hear any of the Whites say 'thank you' and no other regard is given these people. Again and again, it's like they are pets or <phrase_Q=1.000>slaves</phrase>, as the feelings of the people are never even considered. The central <phrase_Q=1.000>illustration</phrase> of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother, Aimée and her servant, Protée. Although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other, the <phrase_Q=1.000>White</phrase> woman never considers Protée or the existence of his feelings. A good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has Protée <phrase_Q=1.000>lace</phrase> up her dress and it's obvious that he is very <phrase_Q=0.957>sexually frustrated</phrase> by this. Apart from this relationship, while almost all the Whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the Africans are people, a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbage. Also interesting is the relationship between Protée and the little girl ( who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> ) . While they are very close, at times he's more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with <phrase_Q=1.000>native</phrase> children. There is one bizarre <phrase_Q=1.000>White</phrase> character who seems, at times, to regard the Blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing. One moment, he's doing hard work along side the Blacks or eating with them ( something the other Whites would never have done ) and the next he's trying to beat up Protée! I could only guess as to what motivated him--perhaps he was just a <phrase_Q=1.000>jerk</phrase>, or was crazy or perhaps was a <phrase_Q=1.000>Communist</phrase> agitator trying to stir up the Blacks against the Whites ( who knows! ) . In fact, other than a few good scenes, this character seems pretty much wasted. While I really enjoyed the insight this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> gave, I wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small <phrase_Q=1.000>period</phrase> of her <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase>. The context and what happened to rid the <phrase_Q=1.000>country</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>colonialism</phrase> is never addressed and the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> left me wanting more. The <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> appeared to begin in the <phrase_Q=0.825>early 1980s</phrase> ( since she's wearing a <phrase_Q=1.000>Walkman</phrase>-style headset ) and when the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> went back in time, it seems that it was set about 1960 ( more or less ) , but there was never any mention of the 1950s <phrase_Q=1.000>anti</phrase>-<phrase_Q=1.000>colonialism</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>violence</phrase> or <phrase_Q=1.000>independence</phrase> for the nation in the early 1960s. I am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> screwed up and SHOULD have made the beginning of the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> earlier ( such as the 1970s ) and had the lady think back to her <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> there in the <phrase_Q=0.764>early 1950s</phrase>--before the <phrase_Q=1.000>country</phrase> experienced <phrase_Q=1.000>political</phrase> change. Apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods, using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the <phrase_Q=1.000>country</phrase> was a good idea. And I also appreciated the ending, as it was a <phrase_Q=0.907>pleasant surprise</phrase> when you find out more about the <phrase_Q=1.000>nice</phrase> man who offers her a ride. But overall, it just feels like something is missing--there just isn't any sort of resolution or message other than showing that <phrase_Q=1.000>colonialism</phrase> is thoughtless and cruel.
there is no <phrase_Q=1.000>suspense</phrase> in this serial! When one episode ends the acting is so shoddy, the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how <phrase_Q=1.000>Batman</phrase> and Robin will save the day. No, in fact, the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode! This show is so boring that I can't see how it ever got made, let alone released on <phrase_Q=1.000>DVD</phrase>! Obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary <phrase_Q=1.000>Batman</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase>, but even the script is awful. An incoherent <phrase_Q=1.000>babbling</phrase> mess about some evil <phrase_Q=1.000>professor</phrase> and a <phrase_Q=0.927>ray gun</phrase> or something like that, I am not quite sure, because it is too awful to follow. <phrase_Q=1.000>Watch</phrase> the 60s version, or the 90's versions, or even <phrase_Q=1.000>Batman Begins</phrase>, just anything over this version!
This is a <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> that belongs firmly to the 50's. Very surprising that <phrase_Q=1.000>American Film Institute</phrase> has chosen this one for one for the best 100 <phrase_Q=1.000>American</phrase> movies of all-time. I have seen practically all of the movies on that list, and this one is by far the most disappointing one of those. <phrase_Q=1.000>Musical</phrase> numbers ( and there many, many of them ) are VERY overlong and boring, and have absolute no connection with the story. The end of the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> has horribly over-<phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>ballet</phrase> sequency, which naturally has no real relation to the story of the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. It must be admitted, that it is very well made, the <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase> is <phrase_Q=1.000>OK</phrase>, and the dancing done with the highest <phrase_Q=1.000>professional</phrase> standard - but there is no real reason why the <phrase_Q=1.000>sequence</phrase> is included in the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=0.737>main character</phrase> of the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is extremely childlish and unlikeable and behaves in unpolite way. His mental age is about 14. If you want to see a good <phrase_Q=1.000>musical</phrase> made on the "<phrase_Q=0.964>golden age</phrase>" of musicals, go and see "<phrase_Q=1.000>Singing</phrase> in the <phrase_Q=1.000>Rain</phrase>".
Savaged when it came out, this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> now looks handsome and sounds great. A feast of intelligent thoughtful acting, from Gielgud, <phrase_Q=1.000>Kenneth Haigh</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Harry Andrews</phrase> and especially <phrase_Q=1.000>Anton Walbrook</phrase>,and a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young <phrase_Q=1.000>Jean Seberg</phrase>. Preminger doesn't jump around and show off- his <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase> slow takes encourage you to listen and reflect, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shaw without sacrificing complexity.The piece has the look of a made for <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, and is certainly studio bound but none the worse for that. Too many contemporary movies on 'historical' themes cannot resist dumbing down. What would <phrase_Q=1.000>Mel Gibson</phrase> have made of the Maid? Many drooling shots of her on the rack probably, then crisping up on the BBQ as the <phrase_Q=1.000>flames</phrase> take hold. Preminger does none of this. The burning is shown mainly through a guilt-stricken <phrase_Q=1.000>reaction</phrase>. There are a few weak performances, but not enough to cause any serious damage. I <phrase_Q=1.000>caught</phrase> this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> on <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> and was not expecting to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it through, but I was gripped . In our age of <phrase_Q=1.000>religious fundamentalism</phrase> and sacrifice, Joan's story has unexpected <phrase_Q=1.000>resonance</phrase>.
demonicus rocked, you guys need to understand how hard it rocked, unfortunately, the words needed to explain the extent of the rocking have not been discovered. for a tiny idea, <phrase_Q=1.000>pop</phrase> like 50 <phrase_Q=1.000>hits</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>E</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Death</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Factory</phrase> while on the phone with <phrase_Q=1.000>Jesus</phrase>, wait, <phrase_Q=1.000>Jesus</phrase> is on call waiting, you're having <phrase_Q=1.000>phone sex</phrase> with Will Smith on the primary line. seriously, that <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>... so good. you need to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it at least <phrase_Q=1.000>a 4</phrase> times to catch all the subtleties... well, not so much subtleties as much as it takes the length of the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, times 4 in <phrase_Q=1.000>order</phrase> to ponder why the people at full <phrase_Q=1.000>moon</phrase> are allowed to A, <phrase_Q=1.000>live</phrase>, and B, reproduce. what is our world coming to?
I rated <phrase_Q=1.000>Basic instinct 2</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>high</phrase>, yet that <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> got less than <phrase_Q=1.000>a 4</phrase> rating. This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> only got <phrase_Q=1.000>a 4</phrase> from me, but it has 7.3 from over 600 people. I don't see a reason why they like this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> so much. This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is boring, because it hardly ever <phrase_Q=1.000>leaves</phrase> those rooms in that broken big <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase>. And it only has a total of 5 people in this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. It is almost two <phrase_Q=0.763>hours long</phrase> which is <phrase_Q=0.773>totally unnecessary</phrase>. Many of dialogues are slow and meaningless. The <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> tone is also dark <phrase_Q=1.000>blue</phrase> which is depressing to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> can just be shorten to a few sentences. This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> reminds me of "Three times" <phrase_Q=1.000>directed</phrase> by <phrase_Q=1.000>Hou Hsiao hsien</phrase>, that one is equally boring, the dialogues are also equally boring. It also has a <phrase_Q=1.000>high</phrase> rating! I had to <phrase_Q=0.736>stop watching</phrase> that one after the first story finished. This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> lacks of passion or excitement.
"Emma" was a product of what might be called by the First Great <phrase_Q=1.000>Jane Austen</phrase> Cycle of the mid-nineties, and it was recently shown on <phrase_Q=1.000>British</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>television</phrase>, doubtless because of the interest in the <phrase_Q=1.000>author</phrase> created by the Second Great <phrase_Q=1.000>Jane Austen</phrase> Cycle which started with "Pride and <phrase_Q=1.000>Prejudice</phrase>" two <phrase_Q=0.777>years ago</phrase>. We currently have in the cinemas the <phrase_Q=1.000>Austen</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>biopic</phrase> "Becoming Jane", and <phrase_Q=1.000>ITV</phrase> have recently <phrase_Q=1.000>produced</phrase> three <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase> movies based on <phrase_Q=1.000>Austen</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>novels</phrase>. These include "<phrase_Q=1.000>Northanger Abbey</phrase>", the only one of the six <phrase_Q=1.000>major</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>novels</phrase> not to have been filmed previously, so the cycle should now be complete. No doubt, however, there will be more to come in the near future. ( There is, after all, her juvenile "<phrase_Q=1.000>Love</phrase> and Freindship" ( sic ) , the <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>novella</phrase> "Lady Susan", and someone, somewhere, has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments "The Watsons" and "Sanditon". Then there are all those <phrase_Q=1.000>Austen</phrase> sequels churned out by modern writers<phrase_Q=0.801></phrase> ) . The <phrase_Q=0.737>main character</phrase> is Emma Woodhouse, a <phrase_Q=0.827>young lady</phrase> from an aristocratic <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> in Regency <phrase_Q=1.000>England</phrase>. ( Not, as some reviewers have assumed, <phrase_Q=1.000>Victorian England</phrase>- <phrase_Q=1.000>Austen</phrase> died before <phrase_Q=1.000>Queen Victoria</phrase> was even born ) . Emma is, financially, considerably better off than most <phrase_Q=1.000>Austen</phrase> heroines such as Elizabeth Bennett or Fanny Price, and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband. Instead, her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her <phrase_Q=1.000>friends</phrase>. She persuades her friend Harriet to turn down a proposal of <phrase_Q=1.000>marriage</phrase> from a young <phrase_Q=1.000>farmer</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Robert Martin</phrase>, believing that Harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman Mr <phrase_Q=1.000>Elton</phrase>. This scheme goes disastrously wrong, however, as <phrase_Q=1.000>Elton</phrase> has no interest in Harriet, but has fallen in <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> with Emma herself. The speed with which Emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards ( with good reason ) as an unsuitable <phrase_Q=1.000>marriage</phrase> partner for herself. This being a <phrase_Q=1.000>Jane Austen</phrase> plot, Emma turns out to be less of a committed <phrase_Q=1.000>spinster</phrase> than she seems, and she too finds herself falling in <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase>, leading to further complications. Emma always insists that she will not marry without affection, and when she does find a partner, the handsome <phrase_Q=0.962>Mr Knightley</phrase>, we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate <phrase_Q=1.000>marriage</phrase>. It does not, however, seem likely to be a very passionate one ( unlike, say, that of Elizabeth Bennett and <phrase_Q=1.000>Mr Darcy</phrase> ) . Knightley, who is <phrase_Q=0.914>sixteen years</phrase> older than Emma ( she is 21, he 37 ) , and related to her by <phrase_Q=1.000>marriage</phrase>, is more like a <phrase_Q=0.879>father-figure</phrase> than a lover. Much more of a <phrase_Q=0.879>father-figure</phrase>, in fact, than her actual father, a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather. When Emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend <phrase_Q=0.977>Miss Bates</phrase>, it is Knightley who chides her for her lack of manners. ( His <phrase_Q=1.000>surname</phrase> is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly <phrase_Q=1.000>nature</phrase>- <phrase_Q=0.923>nineteenth-century</phrase> gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of <phrase_Q=1.000>mediaeval</phrase> knights with their elaborate codes of <phrase_Q=1.000>chivalry</phrase> ) . Both <phrase_Q=1.000>Gwyneth Paltrow</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>Jeremy Northam</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>play</phrase> their parts very well, but this is not really one of the great screen romances. Of the other characters, I liked Juliet Stephenson's vulgar Mrs <phrase_Q=1.000>Elton</phrase> and Toni Collette's Harriet. I know that in the novel Harriet was a naïve young teenager, whereas here she is more like the character Collette played in "<phrase_Q=1.000>Muriel's Wedding</phrase>"- a gauche, slightly overweight twentysomething, <phrase_Q=1.000>fretting</phrase> about her chances of finding a man. Nevertheless, I felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> and did not detract from Austen's themes. "Emma" is one of Austen's more <phrase_Q=1.000>light</phrase>-hearted works, without the darker overtones of "<phrase_Q=1.000>Mansfield Park</phrase>" or even "Pride and <phrase_Q=1.000>Prejudice</phrase>", and this is reflected on screen. We see a world of beauty and grace, full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners. Apart from the ruffianly <phrase_Q=1.000>gypsies</phrase>, who make a very brief appearance, the only "poor" people we see are Mrs Bates and her daughter, and, as they <phrase_Q=1.000>live</phrase> in the sort of picturesque <phrase_Q=1.000>rose</phrase>-strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over £500,000, we can be sure that their <phrase_Q=1.000>poverty</phrase> is relative, not absolute. In Emma's world, <phrase_Q=1.000>poverty</phrase> is defined as not having your own <phrase_Q=1.000>stately home</phrase>. This is, of course, not a <phrase_Q=1.000>comprehensive</phrase> picture of early <phrase_Q=0.923>nineteenth-century</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase>, but nobody has ever claimed <phrase_Q=1.000>Austen</phrase> as the Regency equivalent of a <phrase_Q=1.000>kitchen-sink</phrase> realist. Sophisticated <phrase_Q=1.000>romantic comedy</phrase>, combined with a keen eye for analysing <phrase_Q=1.000>human</phrase> character, was more in her line. I would not rate this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> quite as highly as the 1994 "Sense and Sensibility" or the recent "Pride and <phrase_Q=1.000>Prejudice</phrase>"- it tends to drag a <phrase_Q=1.000>bit</phrase> in the middle, although it has a strong beginning and strong ending- but it is, in the main, a <phrase_Q=0.768>highly enjoyable</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Austen</phrase> adaptation. 7/10
I <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> bad movies. Not only, because they often are as entertaining as 'really' 'good' <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> ( like <phrase_Q=1.000>Pirates</phrase> of the <phrase_Q=1.000>Caribbean series</phrase> and other <phrase_Q=1.000>Hollywood</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>pathos</phrase> ) , but they often are far better than those <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase>. And that's the reason why I <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Italian</phrase> rip off cinema of 1970s and 1980s. And that's the reason why I especially <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, The Barbarians & the <phrase_Q=1.000>Company</phrase>. <phrase_Q=1.000>Director</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Ruggero Deodato</phrase> has made some actually very good movies, like <phrase_Q=1.000>House</phrase> on the Edge of the <phrase_Q=1.000>Park</phrase>, and also his <phrase_Q=1.000>Atlantis</phrase> Interceptors and <phrase_Q=1.000>Live</phrase> Like a Cop, Die Like a Man are enjoyable <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase> movies. But this is really bad. The Barbarians is so idiotic <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. Peter and <phrase_Q=1.000>David</phrase> Paul as the <phrase_Q=1.000>Barbarian</phrase> Brothers Kutchek and <phrase_Q=1.000>Gore</phrase> are very funny, because of their lack of charisma and <phrase_Q=0.787>acting skills</phrase>. But if they can't <phrase_Q=1.000>act</phrase>, they yell and scream every time they do something important. In one scene people try to hang the <phrase_Q=1.000>Barbarian</phrase> Brothers, and they escape very extraordinary way. Bad acting, bad <phrase_Q=1.000>special effects</phrase>, very stupid story, bad direction, actually everything is bad in this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. I can't describe how much I laughed when I watched this first time. The Barbarians & the <phrase_Q=1.000>Company</phrase> is <phrase_Q=0.830>camp classic</phrase> everybody should see once. If you thought <phrase_Q=1.000>Plan 9 From Outer Space</phrase> is fun camp, this will be a real killer.
I remember seeing this one when I was seven or eight. I must have found the characters round, because they left a impression in my mind that lasted for a <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase> time after the end of the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. And the ending, now that's sad, well... for <phrase_Q=1.000>a 7</phrase>-8 year old kid. I had the opportunity of seeing this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> again lately, and found that the plot was too simple, the character, two-dimensional... I guess it's the kind of <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> that you can only with the innocence of a young child... Pity... I recommend this one for all you parents with small kids... ( I saw it in its original <phrase_Q=1.000>french</phrase> version, so I cannot tell you whether the <phrase_Q=1.000>translation</phrase> is good or not. )
I am not sure who is writing these <phrase_Q=0.924>glowing reviews</phrase> for this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> but trust me it STKINKS. I have seen hundreds of <phrase_Q=1.000>horror films</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>slasher</phrase> flicks and this one is LAME it is only about 80min <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase> and believe me that is all I could take. Plot is terrible, acting is even worse. And there is no development at all. Even the <phrase_Q=1.000>David</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Cocteau</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> are better than this. RUN AWAY from <phrase_Q=1.000>JIGSAW</phrase> . I expected to hate the acting, which can be forgiven in <phrase_Q=1.000>direct to video</phrase> movies, if the plot is good. This had no scares, very little <phrase_Q=1.000>Gore</phrase>, and a truly unattractive cast. I watched this with three other <phrase_Q=1.000>friends</phrase> who I hope are still talking to me! They wanted me to fling the disc out the window. I can not believe anyone could have given this <phrase_Q=1.000>tripe</phrase> a good review.
A must see <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> with great dialogues, great <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase>, great acting and a superb <phrase_Q=1.000>atmosphere</phrase>. In the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> you will follow 8 people for one day in the <phrase_Q=1.000>city</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>antwerp</phrase>, they are all individuals and sometimes plain weird ( that's how I <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> them! ) . I'm not going to say anything else, just go see and enjoy it.
This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> surely has one of the strangest themes in <phrase_Q=1.000>history</phrase> -- right up there with <phrase_Q=0.984>Ed Wood's</phrase> impassioned defense of <phrase_Q=1.000>cross-dressing</phrase> in "Glen or Glenda?" The subject: playing <phrase_Q=1.000>bridge</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=1.000>Park Avenue</phrase> set plays it; the <phrase_Q=1.000>Bohemians</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>play</phrase> it. The <phrase_Q=1.000>Russians</phrase> -- who speak very questionable "<phrase_Q=1.000>Russian</phrase>" and have most unconvincing accents when they <phrase_Q=0.844>speak English</phrase> -- <phrase_Q=1.000>play</phrase> it at the <phrase_Q=1.000>restaurant</phrase> where they work. If one isn't interested in <phrase_Q=1.000>bridge</phrase>, one -- even despite the great cast -- isn't likely to be much interested in this bizarre <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. <phrase_Q=1.000>Loretta Young</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>Paul Lukas</phrase> are fine. ( Well --<phrase_Q=1.000>Frank McHugh</phrase> is an unlikely <phrase_Q=1.000>ghost</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>writer</phrase> -- as <phrase_Q=1.000>Lukas</phrase> is an unlikely <phrase_Q=1.000>Russian</phrase>. ) But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script.
I first heard of this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> after purchasing the 1976 flick "Snuff". I was told that <phrase_Q=0.987>Devil's Experiment</phrase> was much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered the <phrase_Q=1.000>Guinea Pig</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>box set</phrase>. I was really interested to hear that <phrase_Q=1.000>Charlie Sheen</phrase> had come out trying to ban either this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> or the second one, so my interest was peaked. <phrase_Q=0.987>Devil's Experiment</phrase> is a <phrase_Q=1.000>short film</phrase> with no story, no <phrase_Q=0.826>character development</phrase>. Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes. They <phrase_Q=1.000>torture</phrase> her in various ways like beating her, spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink <phrase_Q=1.000>alcohol</phrase>, forcing her to listen to hi-<phrase_Q=1.000>pitched</phrase> noise for 24 hours, smash her hand with a <phrase_Q=1.000>mallet</phrase>, burning and putting <phrase_Q=1.000>maggots</phrase> on the burns, throwing guts at her, and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye. I must say that a lot of this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> was fake, like the beating scenes. But then, some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out. The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me <phrase_Q=1.000>dizzy</phrase> watching it. Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. The worst is the eye scene. I didn't shutter when watching it but simply thought "Damn, that looks pretty good for such a <phrase_Q=0.793>low budget</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>". I did enjoy the flick but I don't know if I can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the <phrase_Q=1.000>horror genre</phrase> has to offer. 7/10
Oh my <phrase_Q=1.000>god</phrase>, what a horrible <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> has all the right people involved, unfortunately it is not <phrase_Q=0.735>worth watching</phrase>. I saw it for <phrase_Q=1.000>free</phrase> at my <phrase_Q=0.895>local library</phrase>. If I had paid to <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> this I would be even more upset. This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is unwatchable. How could Tarintino be involved with such a <phrase_Q=0.921>slow paced</phrase>, unexciting <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. No wonder it didn't get much distribution, every one involved must have been ashamed. I can make a better <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> with a Dated <phrase_Q=1.000>Camcorder</phrase> and my Big toe. Its beyond boring, I really hated it. Tarintino just <phrase_Q=1.000>lost</phrase> some standing in my eyes. This must be some kind of sick joke. Don't Bother with this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. If some one even hints you should <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it, kill them.
Why should you <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> this? There are certainly no reasons why you shouldn't <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it! Superbly and amusingly <phrase_Q=1.000>directed</phrase> by <phrase_Q=1.000>Albert and David Maysles</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Grey Gardens</phrase> was <phrase_Q=0.908>originally intended</phrase> to be a <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> on the <phrase_Q=1.000>gentrification</phrase> of East Hampton, but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> of the two Edith Bouvier Beales, the aunt and cousin of <phrase_Q=1.000>Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</phrase>. Their <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> was certainly an amusing one ( Edith spent most of her day in bed <phrase_Q=1.000>singing</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>operas</phrase>, Edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats, one was named Ted Z. <phrase_Q=1.000>Kennedy</phrase> ) The <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is interesting because it is both funny and sad - Edith died shortly after the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> was released ( in February 1977 ) aged 82 after experiencing some of the fame that she and Edie received after the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> ( she danced and sang in a <phrase_Q=1.000>nightclub</phrase> Edie Beale <phrase_Q=1.000>Jr</phrase> was born in 1925 and is still living in <phrase_Q=1.000>Miami</phrase> Beach.This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is both engaging and spellbounding.
Although it really isn't such a terribly <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> ( especially considering it was made directly for <phrase_Q=1.000>TV</phrase>-distribution ) , it'll be very difficult to point out one <phrase_Q=1.000>aspect</phrase> in "Bloodsuckers" that is actually original or refreshing. <phrase_Q=1.000>Vampires</phrase> in space isn't exactly a new formula, and even after so many movies dealing with these monsters in this particular setting, still no one seems to realize it's an <phrase_Q=0.855>incredibly stupid</phrase> premise that can't possibly result in a <phrase_Q=0.916>halfway decent</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>horror movie</phrase>. "Bloodsuckers" even goes one step further and shamelessly imitates every imaginable <phrase_Q=1.000>motion picture</phrase> that either revolves on <phrase_Q=1.000>vampires</phrase> and intergalactic warfare. The plot and characters are mainly <phrase_Q=1.000>stolen</phrase> directly from <phrase_Q=0.977>John Carpenter's</phrase> "Ghosts of <phrase_Q=1.000>Mars</phrase>" and James Cameron's "Aliens", as a crew of futuristic <phrase_Q=1.000>vampire</phrase> hunters are crusading through space and regularly holding to eliminate a mutated <phrase_Q=1.000>species</phrase> that peculiarly named themselves after notorious <phrase_Q=1.000>horror</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>icons</phrase>, like the Voorhees and the Leatherfaces. The good guys are a bunch of pathetic <phrase_Q=1.000>stereotypes</phrase>, constantly dealing with clichéd issues and endlessly arguing about dreadfully unimportant matters. <phrase_Q=1.000>Captain</phrase> Damian is the unpopular rookie, who'll really have to prove his <phrase_Q=1.000>leadership</phrase> capabilities now after being more or less responsible for the <phrase_Q=1.000>death</phrase> of the previous ( and far more loved ) <phrase_Q=1.000>Captain</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Churchill</phrase>. The other annoying characters include a typical <phrase_Q=1.000>cowboy</phrase>-style and <phrase_Q=0.934>trigger happy</phrase> macho <phrase_Q=1.000>pilot</phrase>, a tough female warrior with more balls than any of the males on board ( she's of <phrase_Q=1.000>Asian</phrase> descent, like the girl in "Aliens" was <phrase_Q=1.000>Latino</phrase> ) and the army's most valuable secret <phrase_Q=1.000>weapon</phrase>: a Blade-girl! Quintana is a beautiful and deadly <phrase_Q=1.000>vampire</phrase> who chose the side of humans. She can spot enemies when they're still <phrase_Q=1.000>light-years</phrase> away and she can also do wickedly sexy things with someone's wet dreams. They eventually all learn to work as a team when forced to face the ultimate <phrase_Q=1.000>vampire</phrase>-meanie: <phrase_Q=1.000>Michael Ironside</phrase> ( in yet another downgrading role ) . "Bloodsuckers" is an irredeemably stupid <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, but it manages to entertain as <phrase_Q=1.000>long</phrase> as it features gory killings, infantile dialogs and OTT make-up effects. It only gets intolerably boring when the frustrated soldiers blame the <phrase_Q=1.000>captain</phrase> for the umpteenth time and <phrase_Q=0.955>bla bla</phrase> bla. This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is a non-stop series of lame <phrase_Q=1.000>clichés</phrase> and uncreative ideas, but at least it's watchable.
This sad little <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>bears</phrase> little similarity to the 1971 <phrase_Q=1.000>Broadway</phrase> revival that was such a 'nostalgic' hit. Keep in mind that when <phrase_Q=1.000>Burt Shevelove</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>directed</phrase> that revival, he rewrote the <phrase_Q=1.000>book</phrase> extensively. I have a feeling that this <phrase_Q=1.000>screenwriter</phrase> wrought as much of a change from the original 1925 version as well. I played the 'innocent philanderer' <phrase_Q=1.000>Jimmy Smith</phrase> on-stage in 1974, and thought this $1 <phrase_Q=1.000>DVD</phrase> would bring back memories. Not a chance. Even the anticipated delight of seeing "Topper" <phrase_Q=1.000>Roland Young</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>play</phrase> 'my' part was a <phrase_Q=1.000>major</phrase> disappointment. Three songs from the <phrase_Q=1.000>play</phrase> remain, and are done very poorly. Even the classic <phrase_Q=1.000>duet</phrase>, "<phrase_Q=1.000>Tea</phrase> For Two", is done as a virtual solo. The many <phrase_Q=0.904>familiar faces</phrase> in this 1940 fiasco do not do themselves proud at all, and the <phrase_Q=1.000>star</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Anna Neagle</phrase>, just embarrasses herself. When I feel gypped by spending a dollar, I know the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> must be bad. Another commentator mentioned the Doris Day version, which is actually called "<phrase_Q=1.000>Tea</phrase> For Two" and is about doing the <phrase_Q=0.895>stage play</phrase> ( the original, of course ) , so those who are seeking the true "No No Nanette" might find a more recognizable version there.
WHEN I first saw this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, in <phrase_Q=1.000>London</phrase>, in 1958, I was bowled over. I had never seen a <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> like this before. It had a strange, <phrase_Q=1.000>hypnotic</phrase> effect, quite unlike the <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> that I had seen previously and it left a lasting impact. I believe that Odile Versios & <phrase_Q=1.000>Marina Vlady</phrase> are sisters, if not <phrase_Q=1.000>twins</phrase>. Certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer. If this has been converted to <phrase_Q=1.000>DVD</phrase> - in <phrase_Q=1.000>Region</phrase> 2 format - and in the original <phrase_Q=1.000>French language</phrase>, I would <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> to hear about it & where it can be purchased.
This would've been a *great* <phrase_Q=1.000>silent film</phrase>. The acting really is good, at least in a Look <phrase_Q=1.000>Ma</phrase>, I'm Doing Really Big Acting! sort of way. Everything is HUGE. Every line is PROFOUND! Every scene is SHATTERED BY <phrase_Q=1.000>HUMAN</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>TRAGEDY</phrase>! Mostly, I felt like gagging. Yet, like any <phrase_Q=1.000>train</phrase> wreck, I couldn't tear my eyes away. This dialogue might've worked on the stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, haphazard, hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative <phrase_Q=1.000>adjective</phrase> you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work. If you enjoy your <phrase_Q=1.000>melodrama</phrase> in huge, heaping doses, you *might* enjoy the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. Be prepared to wait, however. For all that <phrase_Q=1.000>melodrama</phrase>, this thing sure plods along at its own pace. This script must've sounded a lot different when the <phrase_Q=1.000>actors</phrase> involved were <phrase_Q=1.000>reading</phrase> it to themselves. It simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the <phrase_Q=1.000>camera</phrase>. <phrase_Q=1.000>IMDB</phrase> does us a great disservice, at times, when it uses its <phrase_Q=1.000>goofy</phrase> computer-controlled "weighted score". Curse of the Starving Class deserves less than a 1. <phrase_Q=0.838>Character-driven</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>fiction</phrase> is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or <phrase_Q=1.000>evolution</phrase>, it isn't <phrase_Q=0.826>character development</phrase>! Your characters must have a <phrase_Q=1.000>motivation</phrase>. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* <phrase_Q=0.826>character development</phrase>. That's a plot contrivance. Stay away from this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. Or at the very least, <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it muted. Perhaps you'll get some <phrase_Q=1.000>amusement</phrase> from all the arm-waving the characters do. Oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, you see <phrase_Q=1.000>James Woods</phrase> in all his dangly male "look-at-me, I'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man" glory. Don't say you weren't warned.
Nobody truly understands the <phrase_Q=1.000>logic</phrase> behind the numbering of <phrase_Q=1.000>Italian</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>zombie</phrase>-flicks, but  honestly  why would we bother? Every <phrase_Q=1.000>single</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> in the Zombi-"series" delivers great fun, nasty <phrase_Q=1.000>gore</phrase> and gratuitous shocks and "<phrase_Q=0.792>Zombi 3</phrase>" is no exception to this, despite all the <phrase_Q=1.000>production</phrase> difficulties that occurred whilst <phrase_Q=1.000>shooting</phrase>. This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> began as an interesting <phrase_Q=1.000>Lucio Fulci</phrase> project, who had to elaborate further on his "<phrase_Q=1.000>Zombi 2</phrase>" success, but it ended up being a typical <phrase_Q=1.000>Bruno Mattei</phrase> product with more flaws and <phrase_Q=1.000>stolen</phrase> ideas from <phrase_Q=0.754>previous films</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=1.000>screenplay</phrase> is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity, every ingenious idea from George A. Romero's "Night of the <phrase_Q=0.890>Living Dead</phrase>" and "The Crazies" is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at. Yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over-the-top <phrase_Q=1.000>gore</phrase> compensates for everything! On a <phrase_Q=1.000>secret army</phrase> base at the Phillipines, scientists completed the <phrase_Q=1.000>bacterial</phrase> warfare <phrase_Q=1.000>virus</phrase> "<phrase_Q=1.000>Death</phrase> One" and prepare it for <phrase_Q=1.000>transport</phrase>. After a failing attempt to steal the <phrase_Q=1.000>virus</phrase>, the infected corpse of a <phrase_Q=1.000>terrorist</phrase> is cremated and the <phrase_Q=1.000>zombie</phrase>-ashes contaminate the entire <phrase_Q=1.000>population</phrase> of a nearby <phrase_Q=1.000>tourist</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>village</phrase>. The last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong <phrase_Q=1.000>zombies</phrase> as well as soldiers in <phrase_Q=1.000>white</phrase> overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated <phrase_Q=1.000>area</phrase>. This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is comparable to Umberto Lenzi's "Nightmare <phrase_Q=1.000>City</phrase>". Truly Bad...but incredibly entertaining with <phrase_Q=0.906>fast-paced</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase> sequences and several very creative <phrase_Q=1.000>zombie</phrase>-madness situations. The <phrase_Q=1.000>undead</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>birds</phrase> were original, for example, and the whole <phrase_Q=1.000>zombie</phrase> birth <phrase_Q=1.000>sequence</phrase> at the deserted <phrase_Q=1.000>hospital</phrase> was <phrase_Q=0.791>pretty cool</phrase> as well. The infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant <phrase_Q=1.000>Italian</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>zombie</phrase> flick. Recommended to the fans; don't mind the <phrase_Q=0.895>negative reviews</phrase>.
"The Blob" qualifies as a <phrase_Q=1.000>cult</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>sci-fi</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> not only because it <phrase_Q=1.000>launched</phrase> 27-year old <phrase_Q=1.000>Steve McQueen</phrase> on a trajectory to superstardom, but also because it exploited the popular themes both of <phrase_Q=1.000>alien invasion</phrase> and teenage <phrase_Q=1.000>delinquency</phrase> that were inseparable in the 1950s. Interestingly, nobody in the <phrase_Q=1.000>Kay Linaker</phrase> & <phrase_Q=1.000>Theodore</phrase> Simonson <phrase_Q=1.000>screenplay</phrase> ever refers to the amorphous, scarlet-<phrase_Q=1.000>red</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>protoplasm</phrase> that plummeted to <phrase_Q=1.000>Earth</phrase> in a meteor and menaced everybody in the <phrase_Q=0.883>small town</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>Downingtown Pennsylvania</phrase> on a <phrase_Q=0.945>Friday night</phrase> as "The Blob." <phrase_Q=1.000>Steve McQueen</phrase> won the role of Josh Randall, the old West <phrase_Q=1.000>bounty hunter</phrase> in "Wanted: Dead or Alive," after <phrase_Q=1.000>producer</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Dick Powell</phrase> saw this <phrase_Q=1.000>Paramount Pictures</phrase>' release. Meanwhile McQueen's attractive girlfriend Aneta Corsaut went on to <phrase_Q=1.000>star</phrase> opposite <phrase_Q=1.000>Andy Griffith</phrase> in "The <phrase_Q=1.000>Andy Griffith</phrase> Show" as <phrase_Q=1.000>Sheriff</phrase> Taylor's <phrase_Q=1.000>school</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>teacher</phrase> girlfriend Helen Crump. Of course, neither <phrase_Q=1.000>McQueen</phrase> nor Corsaut were teenagers, but then rarely did actual teenagers <phrase_Q=1.000>play</phrase> actual teenagers. <phrase_Q=1.000>Director</phrase> Irvin S. Yeaworth, <phrase_Q=1.000>Jr</phrase>., made his <phrase_Q=0.957>directorial debut</phrase> with "The Blob." Linaker & Simonson's <phrase_Q=1.000>screenplay</phrase> synthesized four genres: first, the <phrase_Q=1.000>alien invasion</phrase>; second, teenage <phrase_Q=1.000>delinquency</phrase>; third, a <phrase_Q=1.000>murder</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>mystery</phrase>, and fourth; a <phrase_Q=1.000>horror</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>chiller</phrase>. Moreover, while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes, it remains largely anonymous. In other words, the <phrase_Q=1.000>eponymous</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Jell-O</phrase> neither talks nor communicates by <phrase_Q=1.000>telepathy</phrase>. Instead, it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody. The tone of "The Blob" is fairly serious in spite of its somewhat campy <phrase_Q=1.000>nature</phrase>. As the filmmakers point out on the Criterion <phrase_Q=1.000>DVD</phrase> release of "The Blob," the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> opens uncharacteristically for a <phrase_Q=1.000>sci-fi</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>horror</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>thriller</phrase> with our <phrase_Q=1.000>hero</phrase> and heroine in a remote rural locale making out and kissing. Jane ( Anita Corsaut ) and Steve ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Steve McQueen</phrase> ) see a large meteor fall to the <phrase_Q=1.000>earth</phrase> and drive off to find it. Meanwhile, an old man finds the meteor and prods it with a stick. The meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick. When the old timer ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Olin Howland</phrase> of "The Paleface" ) gets a closer look at it, the goop attaches itself to his hand. The old guy <phrase_Q=1.000>runs</phrase> screaming from the <phrase_Q=1.000>crater</phrase> and Steve nearly <phrase_Q=1.000>hits</phrase> him with his jalopy. Steve and Jane pick the guy up and take him to see Dr. Hallen in <phrase_Q=1.000>town</phrase>. Hallen is poised to leave <phrase_Q=1.000>town</phrase> for a <phrase_Q=1.000>medical</phrase> conference when Steve and Jane bring the old guy to his office. Hallen <phrase_Q=1.000>phones</phrase> his <phrase_Q=1.000>nurse</phrase> to return since he may need to perform an <phrase_Q=1.000>amputation</phrase>. Of course, Hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the man's <phrase_Q=1.000>forearm</phrase>. Hallen sends Steve and Jane to find out what happened. Our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule Steve's fast driving. Steve fools him into a reverse drive <phrase_Q=1.000>race</phrase>, but the <phrase_Q=0.803>local police</phrase> chief Dave ( Earl Rowe ) lets him off the hook. Steve and the teenagers visit the site of the <phrase_Q=1.000>meteor crater</phrase> and find the warm remains of the meteor. After they visit the old man's <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase> and rescue a <phrase_Q=1.000>dog</phrase>, the teenagers <phrase_Q=1.000>split</phrase> for a spooky <phrase_Q=0.888>late night</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> while Steve and Jane return to Dr. Hallen's office. During the interim, the blob has entirely absorbed the old geezer, killed Hallen's <phrase_Q=1.000>nurse</phrase> and attacked the doctor. Neither <phrase_Q=1.000>acid</phrase> thrown on the <phrase_Q=1.000>protoplasm</phrase> nor Hallen's <phrase_Q=1.000>shotgun</phrase> have any effect on the blob. Steve catches a glimpse of the blob absorbing Hallen. When Steve and Jane go to the <phrase_Q=1.000>police</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>department</phrase> to <phrase_Q=1.000>report</phrase> the incident, Dave is frankly incredulous, while <phrase_Q=1.000>Sergeant</phrase> Bert ( John Benson ) believes that it is a prank. Bert has an <phrase_Q=1.000>axe</phrase> to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her <phrase_Q=1.000>car</phrase>. Steve and Jane take them to Hallen's office, but they can find neither hide nor <phrase_Q=1.000>hair</phrase> of anybody, but Dave admits that the office has been vandalized. Against Sgt. Bert's advice, Dave turns the teens over to their respective parents. No sooner have Steve and Jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they <phrase_Q=1.000>venture</phrase> out again. They drive into <phrase_Q=1.000>town</phrase> and spot the old man's <phrase_Q=1.000>dog</phrase> that got away from them in front of a <phrase_Q=1.000>supermarket</phrase>. When they go to retrieve the mutt, Steve steps in front of the electric eye door of the <phrase_Q=1.000>grocery store</phrase> and it opens. They find nobody inside, but they encounter the blob. Steve and Jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob doesn't attack them. Later, after they escape, Steve persuades the teenagers that challenged him in a street <phrase_Q=1.000>race</phrase> to alert the authorities because he is supposed to be home in bed. <phrase_Q=1.000>Police</phrase> Chief Dave and the fire <phrase_Q=1.000>department</phrase> arrive at the <phrase_Q=1.000>supermarket</phrase>. Steve tries to convince Dave that the blob is in the store. About that time, the blob kills the <phrase_Q=1.000>theater</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>projectionist</phrase> and attacks the moviegoers. Suddenly, a <phrase_Q=1.000>horde</phrase> of people exit the <phrase_Q=1.000>theater</phrase> and Dave believes Steve. Steve and Jane <phrase_Q=1.000>wind</phrase> up at a <phrase_Q=1.000>lunch counter</phrase> that the blob attacks. The proprietor and our heroes hole up in the cellar and Steve discovers that a fire extinguisher with its freezing contents forces the blob to back off. The authorities collect every fire extinguisher in <phrase_Q=1.000>town</phrase> and manage to freeze the blob. The <phrase_Q=1.000>Pentagon</phrase> sends down a team to <phrase_Q=1.000>transport</phrase> the blob to the <phrase_Q=1.000>North Pole</phrase>. As the remains of the blob drift down to the polar <phrase_Q=1.000>ice</phrase> pack, the end credit appears with a ghostly giant <phrase_Q=1.000>question mark</phrase>. <phrase_Q=1.000>Producer</phrase> James B. Harris obtained <phrase_Q=1.000>stock</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>military</phrase> footage of a Globe <phrase_Q=1.000>master</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>military</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>transport</phrase> plane depositing the <phrase_Q=1.000>parachute</phrase> and its <phrase_Q=1.000>cargo</phrase>. "The Blob" proved to be a drive-in hit and Steve McQueen's surge to stardom gave the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> added <phrase_Q=1.000>momentum</phrase>. Unless you are a juvenile, this little <phrase_Q=1.000>horror movie</phrase> isn't scary at all, but Yeaworth and his scenarists create a sufficient amount of <phrase_Q=1.000>paranoia</phrase> and sympathy for our heroes. They never show the blob actually assimilating its victims and leave this to your imagination, so "The Blob" isn't without a modicum of subtlety.
All of the people reviewing this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, and probably many <phrase_Q=1.000>professional</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> reviewers, just don't get it. This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> was made with matting sequences and <phrase_Q=1.000>art</phrase> techniques quite like the works of the great <phrase_Q=1.000>Czech</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>filmmaker</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Karel Zeman</phrase>. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you get any of Zeman's <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase>, such as The Fabulous World of <phrase_Q=1.000>Jules Verne</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>Baron Munchausen</phrase>, Journey to the Beginning of Time, or On The <phrase_Q=1.000>Comet</phrase>. If you are unable to locate a <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>, then read the reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If one were to look at Zeman's work and try to compare it to any of the other <phrase_Q=1.000>sci/fi</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>fantasy</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> of the time, viewers probably wouldn't have gotten it then either. It is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers' styles to the standard technologies of the day, because both Zemen and Hines "do not compute". They have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their <phrase_Q=1.000>creativity</phrase> only. If you look at this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> from a perspective where you KNOW that he intentionally tried to create a <phrase_Q=1.000>pastiche</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>collage</phrase> of mattes mixed with <phrase_Q=1.000>live action</phrase>, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. It isn't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow. I thought that the creatures were also quite good, also considering how they were made. Hines took a great gamble, and I think his <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> will not be fairly judged for years to come. Someone promoting the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing, rather than let them blindly go into the <phrase_Q=1.000>theater</phrase> expecting the usual CG work. Regarding the <phrase_Q=1.000>actors</phrase>, I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's <phrase_Q=1.000>book</phrase>, in that many of Zemen's <phrase_Q=1.000>actors</phrase> were somewhat expressionless at first, but became much more engaging as the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase> went on. It is totally refreshing to me to have this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> in my <phrase_Q=1.000>library</phrase>. I will <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it for years to come, all three great hours of it.
<phrase_Q=1.000>High school</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>friends</phrase> Andre Kriegman and Cal <phrase_Q=1.000>Gabriel</phrase> declare <phrase_Q=1.000>war</phrase> on their classmates and plan a terrifying <phrase_Q=1.000>assault</phrase> on their <phrase_Q=1.000>high school</phrase>. As they begin the deadly <phrase_Q=1.000>countdown</phrase> to their <phrase_Q=0.772>final act</phrase> of revenge, the two start a <phrase_Q=1.000>video</phrase> diary to explain their feelings and chronicle their mission. There is another similar <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> like this, called "<phrase_Q=1.000>Elephant</phrase>." Why do I bring this up? To compare the two <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase>, of course. I have to say, even though I liked "<phrase_Q=1.000>Elephant</phrase>," this is a much better <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. What's the difference, you ask? Well, for starters, this is <phrase_Q=1.000>shot</phrase> differently, much along the lines of "<phrase_Q=1.000>Cloverfield</phrase>," "<phrase_Q=1.000>Blair</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>Witch</phrase> Project," and "Diary of the Dead." This makes the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> all the better because it's much more painfully realistic. But what won me over was how the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> was willing to show the "other side of the story." You get to know these two shooters, unlike "<phrase_Q=1.000>Elephant</phrase>." I actually cared for one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did. This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> actually makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that's a good thing because it's not always <phrase_Q=1.000>black</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>white</phrase>. To be honest, this is why I almost cried in this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. The characters are real <phrase_Q=1.000>human</phrase> beings with <phrase_Q=1.000>logic</phrase> and reasons behind their actions. You get to understand them. It's not like they want to kill people for attention. Overall, this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is emotionally gripping and very haunting and much better than "<phrase_Q=1.000>Elephant</phrase>."
Just imagine the real <phrase_Q=1.000>Hitler</phrase>, who was a <phrase_Q=1.000>master</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>propaganda</phrase> and speech, would have been such a mumbling moron as <phrase_Q=1.000>Carlyle</phrase> portrayed him in this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. Nobody would have followed him, not even a desperate, unemployed guy in the 1920s. This is just a <phrase_Q=1.000>Hollywood</phrase> cardboard piece of <phrase_Q=1.000>propaganda</phrase> itself, disguised as "true <phrase_Q=1.000>history</phrase>". I pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show. <phrase_Q=1.000>Carlyle</phrase> and the producers didn't get anything right with this. Why was <phrase_Q=1.000>Hitler</phrase> able to win so many people, a whole <phrase_Q=1.000>county</phrase> for his ideas if we was such a <phrase_Q=1.000>sausage</phrase>? Why did people follow him to <phrase_Q=1.000>death</phrase>? By portraying him as such a loser they make their own <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> <phrase_Q=0.816>totally unbelievable</phrase>. This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is a mixture of old <phrase_Q=1.000>WW2</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>propaganda</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>MTV</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>urban</phrase> myths about one of the most important persons of the last century. Imagine a <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> about <phrase_Q=1.000>Churchill</phrase> where the <phrase_Q=1.000>director</phrase> only shows him as a drunkard for 90 mins. This <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> is a disgrace and I wonder how they could <phrase_Q=1.000>talk</phrase> an <phrase_Q=1.000>actor</phrase> like <phrase_Q=1.000>Carlyle</phrase> into this dreck.
An executive, very successful in his <phrase_Q=1.000>professional</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> but very unable in his familiar <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase>, meets a boy with down syndrome, escaped from a residence . Both characters feel very alone, and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase>... With this argument, the somehow Amelie-like <phrase_Q=1.000>atmosphere</phrase> and the sentimental <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase>, I didn't expect but a moralistic disgusting <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. Anyway, as there were some interesting scenes ( the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy ) , and the interpretation of both <phrase_Q=1.000>actors</phrase>, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to go on watching the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. The <phrase_Q=1.000>French</phrase> cinema, in <phrase_Q=1.000>general</phrase>, has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase>, opposed to the more stereotyped <phrase_Q=1.000>American</phrase> cinema. But, because of that, it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending, with the impossible <phrase_Q=1.000>death</phrase> of the boy, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive's <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase>, the cheap moral, the unbearable laughter of the daughters, the guy waving from <phrase_Q=1.000>heaven</phrase> as <phrase_Q=1.000>Michael Landon</phrase>... Really nasty, in my humble opinion.
How low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory? ST:HF will be glad to show you. If you are used to seeing what made for a good <phrase_Q=1.000>Star Trek</phrase> show, do NOT <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> this. The writing is <phrase_Q=0.913>hodge-podge</phrase>, the <phrase_Q=1.000>actors</phrase>' portrayals of their characters weak, and most of all, the <phrase_Q=1.000>design</phrase> work is downright doggy. Like watching strong captains, don't look here! Like the strong Federation attitude? Forget about it here! <phrase_Q=1.000>Starfleet</phrase> is mocked by ensigns wearing SPIKES in their <phrase_Q=1.000>hair</phrase>. While a seemingly mentally feeble <phrase_Q=1.000>captain</phrase> shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show's credits, <phrase_Q=1.000>Ensign</phrase> Spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an <phrase_Q=1.000>engineer</phrase>. It just degrades from there. No, not even uniforms match, for goodness <phrase_Q=1.000>sake</phrase>. They are too small or too big, collars down to their chests, and <phrase_Q=1.000>TNG</phrase> Seasons One and Two Uniforms mixed in with <phrase_Q=1.000>Season</phrase> Three and DS9 uniforms. The strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this <phrase_Q=1.000>production</phrase> down to the treads! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seem to improve a <phrase_Q=1.000>bit</phrase> with each <phrase_Q=1.000>season</phrase>. <phrase_Q=1.000>OK</phrase>, I take that back. Who uses CG that inexpertly? The designers of this show. Don't bother with it, it will offend your <phrase_Q=1.000>Star Trek</phrase> sense, as it did mine. Not even the throw <phrase_Q=1.000>backs</phrase> to previous shows can save this catastrophe. I wept openly when i watched this, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost ruptured. That bad.
This show seemed to be kinda good. <phrase_Q=1.000>Kyra Sedgwick</phrase> is an <phrase_Q=1.000>OK</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>actress</phrase> and I like <phrase_Q=1.000>police</phrase> series, but somewhere in the <phrase_Q=1.000>production</phrase> this program went awfully wrong. First of all, the writers should have more suspects than one, you know who did it EVERY TIME!!!!! That makes it boring. The <phrase_Q=0.737>main character</phrase> is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way. I know they wanted her to be tough, but shes mean, stupid and a bad chief. The crimes are uninteresting and bland, and its just lame all the way. As stated above, I hate it.... All in all, this was a <phrase_Q=0.828>big disappointment</phrase> and very bad indeed...
I just saw this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> tonight, <phrase_Q=0.879>opening night</phrase>. It was great!! I'm a <phrase_Q=0.737>big fan</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>sports</phrase> movies, and this was right up there as one of my favorites. <phrase_Q=1.000>Dennis Quaid</phrase> was great. ( Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this...my sister lives in <phrase_Q=1.000>Austin</phrase>, where you <phrase_Q=1.000>live</phrase>.....and she was supposed to buy you a drink once...well...she kinda stood you up...but she didn't mean to! :C ) [not that anyone's going to believe that...] ) ANYWAY, it's a great <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. Everyone who likes a good <phrase_Q=1.000>sports</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, should go out and see it! :C )
Honestly, who in God's name gave this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> an 8.1 rating?? I guess the people who actually made or starred in the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> were the ones who voted. Otherwise this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> sucks! This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is nothing more than an <phrase_Q=1.000>amateur</phrase>, or possibly <phrase_Q=1.000>student</phrase>, <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. I'm a <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> fanatic, and have seen terrible movies, but there was literally nothing redeeming here. The story and acting was the worst I've ever seen. The props, including the use of <phrase_Q=1.000>toy</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>airsoft</phrase> guns with terrible <phrase_Q=1.000>special effects</phrase>, where just as bad as everything else. I'm all for bad <phrase_Q=1.000>language</phrase> in movies, but the F-Bomb was dropped about every third word and I think we might have a winner for the most use of the F-Bomb in any <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> EVER. The <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> also appears to have been filmed using cheap <phrase_Q=1.000>video</phrase> cameras and not actual <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. I'd expect this to get awards for an <phrase_Q=1.000>amateur</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> shown only on <phrase_Q=1.000>public access</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>stations</phrase> around the <phrase_Q=1.000>country</phrase>, but it doesn't belong on a <phrase_Q=1.000>DVD</phrase>. Do not buy this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. Do not rent this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. All I can say was that this was a terrible waste of a <phrase_Q=1.000>free</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> rental coupon. This is valuable time that you will NEVER get back. Unfortunately for me, that time is <phrase_Q=1.000>lost</phrase>, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>, consider this my warning.
While the prices have gone up a lot, and some of the details have become dated, any homeowner who's struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of <phrase_Q=1.000>chuckles</phrase> out of this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. I know I did. Mr. <phrase_Q=1.000>Blandings</phrase>, a New <phrase_Q=1.000>York</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>ad</phrase> executive, decides to move his <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> to the <phrase_Q=1.000>Connecticut</phrase> suburbs and build himself a <phrase_Q=1.000>nice</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase> there. He gets into one hilarious jam after another, from mortgages to lawsuits to <phrase_Q=1.000>construction</phrase> difficulties, as the costs and schedule of the <phrase_Q=1.000>construction</phrase> keep escalating out of control. I thought that the funniest scenes were where <phrase_Q=1.000>Blandings</phrase> hires a contractor to dig a well for <phrase_Q=1.000>water</phrase>. They dig down hundreds of feet, but never find <phrase_Q=1.000>water</phrase>. Yet only a <phrase_Q=1.000>short</phrase> distance away, a few days later, the basement of his <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase>-to-be floods! <phrase_Q=1.000>Cary Grant</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>Myrna Loy</phrase> give believable performances as the harried <phrase_Q=1.000>Blandings</phrase> couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined, and <phrase_Q=1.000>Melvyn Douglas</phrase> is even better as Blanding's <phrase_Q=1.000>lawyer</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> friend. The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. <phrase_Q=1.000>Blandings</phrase> is portrayed as a <phrase_Q=1.000>bit</phrase> of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she's causing, and there's a <phrase_Q=1.000>black</phrase> maid ( horrors! ) . So don't <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> through the social <phrase_Q=1.000>lens</phrase> of 2003, and you'll enjoy it all the more.
WORST <phrase_Q=1.000>MOVIE</phrase> EVER!!!! Can't believe I wasted 90min of my <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> watching this crap. The only reason I didn't turn it off was I wanted to see the <phrase_Q=1.000>Gangster</phrase> dude on the <phrase_Q=1.000>cover</phrase> and he wasn't even in it <phrase_Q=1.000>talk</phrase> about <phrase_Q=1.000>False advertising</phrase>. The people that gave this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> a ten are either Dumb,Stupid or <phrase_Q=0.885>CAST MEMBERS</phrase> or <phrase_Q=1.000>friends</phrase> of <phrase_Q=0.885>CAST MEMBERS</phrase>. I gave it a solid 2 because no one else did I have to write more and I don't even want to. wasting my time talking about this rubbish. Please don't <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it and if you did then vote so this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> can go where it belongs. bottom 100 movies. i can't even tell you how bad it really is. think the worst <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> ever that you've seen then times that be ten and thats this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. It sucked!! If you just think I'm being bitter then <phrase_Q=1.000>watch</phrase> it I dare You!! This <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> should be used to <phrase_Q=1.000>torture</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>war criminals</phrase> or Terriosts. If they <phrase_Q=1.000>Watch</phrase> this even two times and they'll be spilling the beans and begging for MERCY!!
Awwww....yes, it is heartwarming and all that some unlucky <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> gets adopted by <phrase_Q=1.000>ABC</phrase>/<phrase_Q=1.000>Sears</phrase> and has their home "renovated." That's where the humanistic <phrase_Q=1.000>appeal</phrase> ends. I liked it early in its run, but now this show has become disgustingly excessive. Ten needy families could be given relatively luxurious homes with lots of <phrase_Q=1.000>goodies</phrase> for every one <phrase_Q=1.000>family</phrase> that each episode of this show splurges on. The people at <phrase_Q=1.000>Habitat</phrase> For Humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a healthy sixteen year old boy to have a <phrase_Q=1.000>jacuzzi</phrase> in his bedroom, or have his bed tricked-out with "<phrase_Q=1.000>Low Rider</phrase>" <phrase_Q=1.000>hydraulics</phrase>? Does the mom really need her dilapidated, non-running and rusted out old pick-up <phrase_Q=1.000>truck</phrase> restored and "pimped" by some of the best customizers in <phrase_Q=1.000>California</phrase>? A new one would have done the job quite nicely, and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a sixty-five inch plasma screen in every room of the <phrase_Q=1.000>house</phrase>? And then there's the issue of who pays the increased <phrase_Q=1.000>property taxes</phrase> and utility <phrase_Q=1.000>bills</phrase>. Even after the zaniacs at "Makeover" leave, somebody still has earn a living. I doubt the <phrase_Q=1.000>friendly</phrase> folks down at <phrase_Q=1.000>Social Services</phrase> will see the humor in all of this largess. This show is nothing more than a ratings grabber for <phrase_Q=1.000>ABC</phrase>, and a tacit commercial for its sponsors.
While the story is sweet, and the dancing and <phrase_Q=1.000>singing</phrase> in the main part of the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> are a joy, the uniqueness of the <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase> ( and what makes it a masterpiece ) is <phrase_Q=1.000>the dream</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>sequence</phrase>. It features the combination of the highest form of truly <phrase_Q=1.000>American</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase> ( <phrase_Q=1.000>Gershwin</phrase> ) , the engaging beauty of <phrase_Q=1.000>French</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>impressionistic</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>art</phrase>, Kelly's enthralling <phrase_Q=1.000>choreography</phrase> ( including his rapturous "pas de deux d'amour", really a separate <phrase_Q=1.000>genre</phrase> ) , with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set. Matching the surging <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase> and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great <phrase_Q=1.000>artist</phrase>.
-Kidnappings in <phrase_Q=1.000>Mexico</phrase> are as common as honeys giving me their phone numbers so if you're rich then you'll need a good <phrase_Q=1.000>bodyguard</phrase> to keep you and your kids safe. A couple hires a washed up <phrase_Q=1.000>bodyguard</phrase> called Creasy to protect their adorable kid <phrase_Q=1.000>Pita</phrase>. At first, their relationship is a tad buggy but after a while, Creasy eases up to the girl and the two develop a father/daughter relationship. One day <phrase_Q=1.000>Pita</phrase> is kidnapped and Creasy is badly injured in the process. When he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a <phrase_Q=1.000>ransom</phrase> negotiations that went wrong and this sets Creasy on a path find the men responsible for her <phrase_Q=1.000>death</phrase> and make sure they are brought to his <phrase_Q=1.000>brand</phrase> of <phrase_Q=1.000>justice</phrase>. -Keep some Tylenol next to you while watching this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> because you will need to take some after watching it. I really <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right. The only problem is the annoying <phrase_Q=0.826>visual style</phrase>, which will either make you hate the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> or hate <phrase_Q=1.000>Tony Scott</phrase>. I really feel sorry for the <phrase_Q=1.000>cinematographer</phrase> because I'm sure he came into this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> thinking he was going to be filming an <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the DP for a <phrase_Q=1.000>filmmaker</phrase> that feels that the whole <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> should look like it's been possessed by <phrase_Q=1.000>demons</phrase>. I wouldn't have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase> scenes but when it's spread through out the whole <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> then that's when we have some problems. The same annoying style was recently used on "Domino" and much like with this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> the style did hurt that otherwise great <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. -Another person I feel sorry on this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> was the soon to be great <phrase_Q=1.000>Harry Gregson Williams</phrase> who had the impossible task of trying to <phrase_Q=1.000>compose</phrase> <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase> out of the jagged images. Somehow, <phrase_Q=1.000>Williams</phrase> wrote some decent <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase> for the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> but I'm sure if the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> had been more stable then the <phrase_Q=1.000>music</phrase> would have turned out a lot better. The <phrase_Q=1.000>sound</phrase> is wrongfully used throughout the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> and instead of enhancing the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> experience, it rather makes you feel like you're being punished. The overuse of the <phrase_Q=1.000>subwoofer</phrase> is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end <phrase_Q=1.000>sound</phrase> coming out of it. I don't know why Scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the <phrase_Q=1.000>subwoofer</phrase> but it really takes you away from the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. -The acting in the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> is a beast despite the visuals. Little Fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> just breaks my <phrase_Q=1.000>heart</phrase>. If the end of the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> doesn't make anyone cry then they're dead on the inside. <phrase_Q=1.000>Denzel Washington</phrase> breaks his rule of not making any <phrase_Q=1.000>action</phrase> movies with this <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> and luckily, for him he gets to <phrase_Q=1.000>play</phrase> a great character. The whole idea of a man that's <phrase_Q=1.000>lost</phrase> in <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> and all of a sudden due to a <phrase_Q=1.000>tragedy</phrase> finds a purpose in his <phrase_Q=1.000>life</phrase> is nothing new but <phrase_Q=1.000>Washington</phrase> brings some <phrase_Q=1.000>heart</phrase> and <phrase_Q=1.000>emotion</phrase> to the otherwise flat character. I <phrase_Q=1.000>love</phrase> how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have <phrase_Q=1.000>emotion</phrase> and after the <phrase_Q=1.000>kidnapping</phrase> becoming a cold instrument of revenge. <phrase_Q=1.000>Radha Mitchell</phrase> plays Marc Anthony's wife and she along with Fanning are the two reasons why I can't hate the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> too much. J.Lo's husband comes and goes in the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> but he doesn't really stand out much. <phrase_Q=1.000>Mickey Rourke</phrase> and Chris Walken all have minimal roles in the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase> but they do make an impact. -One thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray <phrase_Q=1.000>Mexico</phrase> by calling it a fine <phrase_Q=1.000>city</phrase> at the end of the <phrase_Q=1.000>movie</phrase>. A little too late for that if you ask me. Let's hope that <phrase_Q=1.000>Tony Scott</phrase> is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a <phrase_Q=1.000>filmmaker</phrase> as talented as him CAN and must do better than this.
First a technical review. The script is so slow, it is really a 25 minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 min. The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. The "acting" is pathetic, they seem to really have lifted schoolchildren out of class to read a few lines from an idiot board. As for the whole "point" of the story, namely "<phrase_Q=1.000>war</phrase> is bad" ( oh, there's a shock! ) is really non-existent. Without out the "lets shock 'em and get great publicity" scene nobody would be talking about this <phrase_Q=1.000>film</phrase>. It is so bad it actually bothers me to think what better things the <phrase_Q=1.000>money</phrase> used this could have gone on. Believe me I've seen some bad "emperor's new clothes" <phrase_Q=1.000>films</phrase> but the one thing I can say for them is at least they were well <phrase_Q=1.000>shot</phrase> and well made while the <phrase_Q=1.000>camera</phrase> wobbled during two scenes in this! Read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and don't <phrase_Q=1.000>talk</phrase> about it.
